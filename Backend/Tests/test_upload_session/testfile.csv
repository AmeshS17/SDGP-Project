This for all intents and purposes is the de facto Team Fighting Game nowadays, it features a great roster, a variety of characters with a variety of moves and playstyles, ease of play for begginer and a big enough challenge for veterans, jaw dropping graphics and animations and a hear warming soundtrack.
The roster is definitely pay to win, characters like Ultra Instinct Goku are broken to all hell, but even with the base roster you can build an amazing team full of top tiers, and with the game being at a state where you can play every character and have a chance to win, it makes for a great experience, with or without dlg.
The final veredict is that this game is amazing and deserves your 60 bucks, but I would advise you to buy it if you want to get into the competitive scene or even if you just want to play ranked at a comfortable level.

77058556,english,"First off, the PS4 version is better in nearly every way, mostly online play. I've logged about 300+ hrs on that version.

Now to main review, FighterZ is a new-player friendly 3v3 Fighting game and does a lot to try and be as streamlined and fun for anyone of all skill levels. I think that it's the best fighting game on the market as most of the specials and basic combos are all really easy to learn unlike something like street fighter, nearly every character has the same input for their basics with room to expirement for everything. However, while it is simple and easy to pick up, a player can explore the depth of characters and using combos that they find online or discover while playing. More often than not, The combos i learn are stuff I get hit with from opponents and then learn through expirementing, usually having my own way of doing it which feels easier on me. 

While i think its the best current fighting game out right now, there are 4 core issues with this game any person who plans to buy/play should know

1. ToDs, Touch of Death, are pretty well known tech that people practice. while most people don't seek out these in online, the Keyword is most. People who do can make an enjoyable online experience feel dreadful. Even more so if they have cost effective one. The game has systems in place to lower damage in combos to midigate this but seeing as it's cool to pull these off and share them, it might sour your expirence of the game watching a round start and you already iimidiately lose due to a character killing your entire team due to one mistake

2. Rushdown Characters. The entire game is fast paced and prioitizes rushdown characters and has system mechanics to make it easier to close in on enemies like superdash and vanish. In a small scale, its fine, but some characters get absolutely ruined because of this. Zoners, Grapplers, characters that need set ups, everything that doesn't rush down is less optimal. Because of this, your playstyle, if its not using rushdown characters, is less optimal than the game wants. While Most characters feel unique, most have the same game plan of just being in close range and keeping pressure on your opponent

3. Overtuned characters. Most characters feel fine, but then there are characters that feel over tuned like Ui Goku and Kid buu. Characters like these can be annoying but reactable offline, but online they completely dominate because of the Frame delay. If you encounter one of these characters, try and avoid getting close until the person starts superdashing or using moves to get close so you can use moves to punish

4. Net play. most fighting games online are bad. Matches take for ever to get and start if someone just doesnt outright just cancel a match request. PS4 has better match making but barely. Still usable just annoying

77046184,english,"I've played a LOT of Extreme Butoden, the game that came out before Fighterz and was the game that this one took a lot of inspiration from, and had the same dev team. Fighterz is a highly polished and upgraded version of EB, with only a few downgrades, such as attacks having less feedback and oomph (mainly audio) when connecting with opponents, and modes being MUCH slower to access. In EB, there was a main menu that allowed you to access all of the game's modes with just a few clicks. In Fighterz, you have to walk around a hub area and talk to an npc to start them. Why? SO much easier to just have a main menu...

With a better story mode, an arcade mode, more characters, subtitles for Japanese dialogue, and MUCH better graphics, effects, and animations (mostly), Fighterz is what I'd consider a true successor to Extreme Butoden. If you have a 3DS and are curious, try EB out.

Defensive game is essentially mk2. For whatever reason outside of point blank range there is no guard-break option so people (yes all the way up the ranks) just defend until an opening. The only thing accessible at close range is a hugely telegraphed built-in auto option or using a very obvious jump-cancel. Stupid. Boring.

Offensive game is frustrating due to supremacy of defense to gain frame+. There are 3 attack buttons but I haven't the faintest clue why. Something about damage scaling but when your average high-level combo is between 60-100k bar damage who the frick cares? Again more needless complexity.

Balance is just utter trash and new heros are op every time and pretty blatant cash grabs.

On the more technical side, it's a rather simple fighting game compared to most others out there but there is still absolutely a lot of freedom when it comes to combos. Neutral is much more unique compared to other fighting games in that you can switch sides during combos or otherwise several times, and the in-game mechanics like superdash, vanish and such give the game's combo structures a unique flavour. And it can absolutely be technical like other fighting games (i.e. Roshi combos).

It's better in my personal -opinion-.  I really don't have anything negative to say about this game, aside from 1 single thing, and it's from a long-term fan perspective.  I'm probably in the minority here, but my favorite character of all time is Raditz, and I'm brutally disappointed in only this specific area because I wanted to see how much justice this game could do him.  I'm not sure what's happened to the perception of Raditz's character in the DB community, but, it feels as though TFS had a heavy influence incidentally on a wide array of characters, even to the extent of receiving unofficial titles like ""Raditz the runt"" through DBZ: Kakarot.  From an Ocean Dub and Funimation depiction of Raditz, it's nigh-impossible to regard him as that.  I understand people are probably blinded by the existence of Gods and Angels in Super now, but for Raditz's time and what he stood for in DBZ originally is impeccable.  If you were growing up watching the show, and you started DBZ right after Dragon Ball directly, immediately seeing a conflicted but mostly evil Piccolo team up with Goku to contest an Alien force that far outweighed them in power was mind-blowing!  I'm not sure how you can even logically make sense of Vegeta and Nappa randomly wasting their time to go to Earth without the concept of Raditz being included.  It was only through Raditz's scouter that Vegeta and Nappa were aware of what transpired on Earth, if not for Raditz, we quite literally would have a different story altogether probably.  It's also Goku's older brother ... and I'm aware we're in 2020 and that relationship still holds no value.  I fear for the future of DBZ and especially Raditz as a whole based on recent years.  Just a concerned and always dedicated fan!  P.S. I would gladly pay 100$ just to have the chance of playing Raditz in an awesome game like this.",1601680980,1601681237,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,24,3,2328,2328,1571,1601832740

-Strong set of fundamental mechanics universal across (most of) the cast
-Fun gameplay flow that has room for open-endedness

Cons:
-Character diversity, the characters all play pretty similarly
-Some mechanics kind of dumb down the game like superdash and autocombo correction
-The netcode is ass
-It can be hard to find a game, especially in lower ranks
-Balance patches are infrequent (and they don't always solve everything)

76702094,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is an amazingly fun fighter and feels pretty manageable to the casual player - if you're like myself, who isn't particularly good at the genre, nor have played other similar titles like Marvel vs Capcom. 

The input execution for special moves is heavily simplified (involving only either quarter-circle-forward/backward motions) and jump cancel timing feels less tight compared to other anime fighters like BlazBlue. This is a good thing because long combo strings generally require chaining into air combo and they are relatively easier to execute here. For the record, I can never quite pull off long combo strings in BlazBlue regardless of how much I practice. But I can do pretty long combos in this game with lesser time spent in training mode and still feel I can get better.

There are also auto-combos (by mashing Light or Medium attacks) which are inherently part of the combo system - imo, I feel they are well-implemented. Auto-combos have certain properties like auto positioning closer to the opponent, making it easier to pull off air combo chains. For e.g. a basic ground-to-air combo like 2M, M, JC, L, M, JC, L, M, H can also be done as 2M, M, JC, L x2, JC, L x3. The latter will be easier to pull off, and that's not just because it requires fewer mixing of inputs but simply because of the auto-positioning itself. The great thing I feel about this is that even if an entry level player uses auto-combos as a crutch, he/she still needs to get into the habit of fairly precise inputs instead of just button mashing (since the latter combo requires hitting L the exact number of times). I think this is a good way to enable a new player to do something complex in a easier manner and condition them with the right habits at the same time.

If I have any complaints about the game, they would be:
- The story mode (which makes up the bulk of single-player content) and its plot are kinda meh.
- The tutorials are not really that useful.
- The OST is largely forgettable, though there are a few tracks that I fancy - like Bardock's and Android 16's themes.

The game is heavily discounted so you should get either the FighterZ or Ultimate Edition when on sale.
Both editions include only the FighterZ Pass 1 (8 additional characters) while the latter includes additional commentator and music tracks if you care about that. Personally, I got the FighterZ edition as the music tracks don't appeal to me. 

Strongly recommended!",1601284212,1601284212,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,93,26,2925,2904,1419,1602076199

76698731,english,"DB FighterZ is probably the best fighting game I ever played. No aggressive microtransactions, smooth gameplay, active playerbase and an amazing roster of character. When they say that FighterZ is not like other fighting games it's not a lie. Arc has made very good fighting games over the years, the most popular being their Guilty Gear series. So yeah, I definitely recommend FighterZ not only to the DBZ and Anime communities but also to those who want to try a fighting game that is more unique than basic fighting games like Street Fighters, Mortal Kombat, etc.

Lets look at this from two ways, One from a prespective of a dragon ball z fan who isnt really good, and the other at the competetive aspect.

First the prespective of a dragon ball fan: this game look good, represents all the characthers wonderfully, animation look PERFECT, and if you are afraid about picking this up beacuse its a fighting game, dont worry auto combos can help you.

Now lets take a look at the other prespective, a fighting game compettive; YOU WILL LOVE THIS, the mechanics are deep and great, with the season 3 you almost can pick anyone you want, the net code is ok but if i got something to give to fighterz about the net code , its that its way better then xenoverse 2.
if you are a fighting game competetive PICK THIS UP.

The TLDR version is fantastic DBZ vs game. Fun at all levels of play wheather you're new to fighting games or a vet. There are quality of life issues with the online though like random disconnects and pretty much no way to communicate besides preset messages. 

[b] Pros [/b]

+++ It has English Dub (My ears thank you)
+++ The attention to detail is amazing, from the stage transitions, the shot by shot movesets to the destructive finishes and lore dynamic finishes.
++   Amazing OST that really compliments the high paced gameplay. 
+++ Game lobby system is this really cool overworld system. You can basically walk up to all the different game modes in server rooms that hold up to 64 players each.
++   Everthing besides future dlc characters can be unlocked via Z capsules (Pretty much exactly like GGXRD fishing)
++   Everything gives you zenny (The currency you need for Z capsules).
++   Rematches are very quick since the game doesn't need reload everytime. 
+     Controllers are well supported for me, but I don't know about arcade stick support.
+     The game is 5 freaking gigs. How is a mystery to me.
+     Fast load times
+     Global Online Tournaments finally added
++   Lobbies are very lively, you'll be able to good matches easily, wheater you're a beginner or vet.

[b] Cons [/b]

- - No voice chat or text chat, just preset messages. 
- - No region filter, only prefered bars
- - ""dbfz UE4-RED game has crashed and will close"" Hope you're not one of the poor souls getting this error
- - Delayed based netcode. Either make your own rollback netcode or use GGPO.
- - - No Crossplay
- - No way to send friend request in game. You can change your ingame name anytime, it's just if you wanna add anyone you played in ranked or something you better hope its the same name as their steam. lol
- People have 30 secs before they have to accept or deline their qued match. This either needs to be shorted to 10 secs or they need to let you cancel the que so you're not trapped waiting for them to do something. lol
- Performance its gotten worse from release. Especially after adding an unneeded EAC. It's not horrible but sad to see how well it ran on launch to now. That on top of the only mods people use is all visual stuff.
- Frames drop when searching ranked/casual matches. Hopefully this gets patched.
- Sound glitch that can happen at random just about anywhere in the game, seems like skipping lines in story causes it the most. It's like a half second of something loud. Probably a sound file playing when it's not intended to.

[b] Whats this game like is it like Mahvel or guilty gear!? [/b]

Basically it's a VS game that takes mechanics from GG and mahvel and puts a dbz like spin on it. A raw tag in this will result in your character superdashing in. Dragon rush's which are unblockable dash attacks are basically the normal grabs of the game. Instead of a pushblock or faultless denfense you have Z reflect, which deflect all attacks including supers and push the oppent back but lose to dragon rush. Sparking is like X factor and Burst fused together.

- Game soft locks if you're in a online lobby and in training mode for a certain amount of time, then change teams. It thinks you're afk but it doesn't try to kick you until you try to go back to the lobby. The game thinks you're going back when you change teams, then loads forever becuase it doesn't know what to do.

- I would love an online training mode to help me explain things to friends easier.

- So [url=https://youtu.be/e8AmR8IZ25M?t=21s] BEAM STRUGGLES [/url] ... where are they? I don't care if they can only be accesed through casuals I need them in this game.

Can I get a Brian drummond voice pack for Vegeta? I love me some Christopher Sabat,
 but [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX20KuQWH7s] THIS VOICE [/url] deserves some spotlight.

[h1] Should you jump on the hype train? [/h1]

For me DBFZ is pretty much everything I could ask for from a dbz game, although for a fighting game I wish there was more to it's mechanics. If you've been hesitant because you're not good at fighting games don't be. Like even you just use the auto combos alone and you want to just smash your friends into mountains, I think you'll find more than enough entertainment with this game. Plus if you ever want to learn how to get better at fighting games you can always do that later.

The fact that you even got this far in the review tells me you're at least interested in the game. That or you're one of my friends who likes to read my reviews out load in the discord like I didn't know.

76222387,english,Honestly i love dragon ball and i love fighting games. Bringing the 2 together is a match made in heaven. The visuals are top notch and i could not imagine a more faithful recreation of the series. The fighting game elements are also well and fully realized. Sure some of the character balance  is a little wack but there are truly no unplayable characters and the ones that are good are not unbeatable. The tutorial elements do leave something to be desired but this is more than made up for by the games community. All this being said I love this game to bits and will probably put way more time into it in the future.

If you are looking for a solid Dragon Ball Z game, be it you are a casual fan or a hardcore competitive player, you certainly can't go wrong with this game. 
Graphics look the best there is with visuals that were carefully detailed to look like the iconic style from the martial arts manga and anime series. Gameplay is the most accessible yet the deepest in a 3 vs 3 fighting game to date. Character roster is still growing and developer Arc System Works has shown interest and respect for it's competitive community by frequently balancing the game even 2 years after it's release. Sound design is pretty good, not much more to say there. 
Story is long enough and there is a lot of character interaction so fans will find a lot to love there. 

Overall, Dragon Ball FighterZ is the game that with it's beautiful visuals, polished gameplay that well represents the source material sets a precedent in how anime fighting games with competitive appeal should be made.

76154962,english,"Unless you have someone to teach you the game is terrible at teaching proper mechanics.

In the challenges and training examples the timing is not clearly defined. This for me makes it very hard to know what I am doing wrong and when I see on screen my character doing what I was told to do.

This is made worse by the story mode that is very long and teaches very bad tactics for pvp and higher levels of arcade fights. So having spent far too many hours getting each character, and learning how to get teams together, what you like from the story mode and who you don't like to play you have ingrained muscle memory that has to be unlearned before you can play against others.

This gets worse when you get to higher challenge levels as the difficulty spikes so fast because you haven't learnt what is good and bad to do in a situation.

I enjoy the game with friends and do not regret getting the game, but as a beginner it taught me terrible mechanics that only frustrate me as I try and go further. I still don't know how to close and because of that I dismiss entire characters as I don't see how I can engage with them.

In addition I understand it is trying to be next Vs game so this may be my frustration coming out, but I find myself in long combos that make me put down the controller and leave as I see no way out. Some form of combo break would be helpful so I don't feel like a passenger for sections of the game.

- Cheating AI in arcade mode. Looks like AI has read player's inputs and has been quicker than players' characters. AI always takes anvantage on players. Disappointed that destroy the fun. (Ironically, there is anti-cheat but AI cheats players)
- Boring story. Only one or two times, you will be bored.
- Lack of offline mode and squad depth. (I don't care for online)
- Overpriced. Some characters should be in the game already, not pass 1 2 3 etc.
- What is fatal error? Sometimes it appears like that without any reasons.

I'd go in with this warning though, everything except for straight vs. mode is pretty disappointing.  The story in particular is one of the worst story modes I've seen in a fighting game.  Still, this is a fighting game.  Vs. mode is the main selling point.

-Pros
=Genuinely a simple but great fighting game
=3v3 format and a large roster (with DLC) means there is a lot of variety
=Another Arcsys 2D/3D stunner
=Fair amount to do outside fighting people online
=West City music track
=New strict anti-Rage quit penalties!

-Cons
=Buying all the DLC is pricey. There is no 'All in one' dlc bundle yet so if you do want to buy the game and want all the characters, buy it on sale.
=Fair amount of single player content but it's whatever.
=Even with the best  pc money can buy you can get annoying fps drops. You will need to tinker to get it running silky smooth, took me a fair bit of twiddling. (Nvidia friends turn Threaded Optimisation and DSR off)

It's Easy to learn but Hard to master, in terms of skill there are Auto-combos which are doable by simply pressing Light Light Light, same for Medium and Heavy respectively. I suggest picking your favourites and practicing with those until you become competent.

After 300+ hours in this game, plenty of games in ranked/casual and few playing buddies in the friends list, I have to say this game is really amazing. However... and listen to this however, because you will need it.

I'm old timer, who's reflexes are not as good as many other ""youngsters"" in the hood, but be prepared if you want to play online for plenty of horrible games. Current Netcode for FigterZ is real garbage and because everyone is using different PC to play, you will find out that not every game is fair for you. V-sync? Additional 1-2 frames, or more. Different graphic settings? Well, the same. You forgot to turn off something in Nvidia dashboard? RiP. Why are you losing guard in many spots? Well, thanks to 3-4 frame delay I guess...These are few things that makes me NOT want to play such game on my PC and use console instead. Saddly, I do only have PS3.

I would say, that I had been having fun for a long time, until I hit SS3/Majin rank and boy I have to say most people play like braindead zombies. I do understand that constant pressure, constant mashing of buttons IS a strategy, but if you try to compare such gameplay to ""pro"" players... it says a lot about such opponent. I'm trying my best to stay neutral in my fighting style, but when you have almost every opponent mashing every button, every millisecond of your match... I don't want to play this game anymore. Sometimes I do feel as if I'm losing my mind while playing some online games, so beware that FighterZ might break you in half, or just online players who you don't know at all. Higher ranks attracts more zombie mashers and that's a big deal, because it shoves off people from the game.

So if you have friends who want to play with you FigterZ, then play with them as much a possible, since Offline gameplay is what makes this game shine the most. I have also tried Remote Play with friend 400km from me and I would say having 4-5 frame delay in it is not as bad as I have thought. It works, but don't expect Unicorns out of nowhere.

This is the end for short update for my review. Take care and I GIVE VIDEL REFLECT, since Hercule will be next DLC character, after Roshi.

[Old part of the review]

I was never a ""fighting games"" guy, but this game is literally what I've been searching for my whole life.

It's not just Dragon Ball game for fans, it's more and more than that. Dragon Ball FighterZ is next in Arc System Studios title, coming after Persona Arena, which already started implementing similar things to what we see in FighterZ. I used to play Persona Arena and Ultimax for a long time, but these games had some issues, and Internet fights were a mess. Since the characters had similar attacks to Fighterz, huge amount of people used to spam long range attacks and breaking whole balance to the fights. It was painful to play some of them. In case of FighterZ, it's completely different. Even if you enjoy spamming range attacks, you can always be punished for your actions, and because of it lose your game. Every character has your standard attacks like: light, medium, high and special. Additionally you will find special attacks, rushing systems, Sparking system, which boosts you, and vanishing attacks for sudde and painful backstabbing in the butt. 3vs3 fighting system is more enjoyable than what Marvel vs Capcom presented, so even if you are mediocre player, FighterZ still can teach you few tricks. 

Since the game features auto-combos, you don't need to learn huge charts from combo-list, unless you really want to. Also, you can try experimenting with combos and find something unique for you. Devs are still bringing more characters to the game and probably (I do really hopes so) they will reveal another season characters. So the game, even after two years after being released, still is being updated on.

The story isn't much to scoff at but there was some effort put in to the actual characters. A21 is a welcome and surprisingly strong addition to DB's cast of waifus. She's not a personal main of mine but I know she has a place in the game's meta, which I'm glad for considering it's a Toriyama OC made just for the game.

I will say there is a SEVERE learning curve and spammers and braindead *cough* Z Broly *cough* strategies are INFURIATING to get caught in. Netcode rollback is also something the game needs but likely won't get until its sequel due to technical limitations of implementing something like that.

74639795,english,"It is a decent fighter over all, if you like that much you'll enjoy this game. The not recommended is because of the imbalance of characters which pigeon hole you into a what is effectively meta. Again most people might actually enjoy the specific team comps that will net you that ""W"" but sadly for new players that ""W"" wont come if you are learning with characters not properly synergized for efficiency.

Graphics - Great nothing wrong here, anime games have come a long-long way.

Music - Most are simply too generic to remember but some are pretty good.

Gameplay - The game is mediocre difficulty to pick up and learn, you'll spend a lot of hours in practice mode since you wont learn much watching other players. The reason is because other players unless you are running top tier are probably running some formula of goku, vegita and kid buu with the occasional broly or bardock. There is nothing to learn from those characters and their variants aside from how to get your ass beat at every trade off. For example their lights or mediums will beat your lights and their heavies will lock you up in most situations. It's a nasty snow ball effect of just a superior character. Also the damage those characters (especially the goku and vegitas) can push out is silly. 

For example: Optimal combo for Andriod 21 will do about 40-55%, requires 3 bars without the 3 bars its about 40% damage, it also requires you have two assists and be in the corner. Base Vegita can do 55% from... anywhere requiring 2 bars one for the vanish.  It wouldn't be too bad if it was just a damage difference but combine that with the that those characters lights, mediums are faster and/or typically have better range then those guys have a better chance of getting in on you.

Beyond that balance problem which isn't normally a problem for arcade fighters that can't be updated, this game is actively updated for balance so it becomes then a problem because it could be solved if they saw it fit to fix it.

Those characters also feel more complete, they simply provide more options in more situations, it makes it so any predictability is based on you as a player. That's good, if someone likes to auto combo just deflect and neutral heavy them, but if they are half way decent they will correct that.

Tons of other modes for co-op gameplay with seasonal and random events.

Cons: 

Online gameplay is full of rage-quitters. If you have the upper hand, several players will ""pull the plug"" to conserve ranked points. This can somewhat be rectified by enabling the ""High Completion Rate"" filter in ranked matchmaking options.

The game will randomly crash! AND for no apparent reason. Around 5% of your launch time will be met with the game crashing and giving a ""UE4-RED"" error. This is sometimes rectified by ensuring Steam's cloud sync is enabled for this game and then deleting your local save data (Win+R, then type ""%localappdata%,"" hit enter followed by deleting the entire Dragonball fighterz folder.)

New character launches present unbalanced characters. Normally with character launches, the new toon is either ridiculously OP/UP. It will normally take a month or so for the balancing patch. If you're a competitive player, this could mean unforeseen advantages/disadvantages for tournament play. Game breaking updates are corrected relatively fast. Usually a week or two.

A slight glitch (since day 1) From time to time, you'll notice the game returning you to your ring match lobby despite the rematch settings to continue on without changing your characters. If someone Alt+F4's from inside your lobby, this will likely happen to you. That or when all parties are returned to the lobby yet the game hangs and presents as if people are still in a match.

Pay for DLC! Although paying for minor additional content has become the norm, I still mark this as a con. The game itself is 60 bucks. With the release of new characters, you'll easily spend 3 times that for all characters bringing the actual game total flying into the upwards of 200 bucks in no time. Each character is around 5 bucks a piece, and a fighterz pass is around 25 bucks for 6 characters. Ultimately, the pass saves you 5 bucks for every 6 characters released, but this is no excuse for such inflated minor DLC prices. The game has a base of 24 characters (3 unlockable) with ~18 DLC characters as of 8/17/20.

It doesn't explain the vast amount of nuance to every character in the game, as far as I can tell (For example: Broly's armor isn't mentioned, or Android 21's ability to copy other character's skills). After an investment of around 35 hours (both inside and outside the game), I feel as though I have not grown as a player, and that doesn't feel good. Additionally, the prices for additional characters is absolutely ridiculous. I understand companies have to make money, but the game already costs a base $60, and to ask $30 more for just another 6 characters is simply grubby.

48659893,english,"EDIT:

im forced against my will to change my review from a positive review to a negative one.
the game has a few flaws. but here is the biggest problem with the game.

the character balance.

unless you plan on only picking the top tiers. dont bother buying the game. the character balance is awful.
it is lliterally impossible to beat a opposing team made up of top tiers with a bottom tier team.
if you play lets say android 17, goku black, cooler team, its impossible to beat a bardock, broly, gt goku team.
IMPOSSIBLE.
if you play ten matches. with someone of equal skill level.
you'll be lucky to win just 1 match.
i have 1,000+ hours dedicated to the game. most achievements unlocked. most medals earned.
meaningless.
because the difference in tiers is vast.
i mostly play the low tiers of 17, videl, cooler, janemba, fat buu, etc etc.
and facing off against broken op af characters like kid buu, bardock, ui goku, broly....
ITS IMPOSSIBLE. its too much of an uphill climb each battle.
you with low tier characters have to play perfect to win against someone mashing their face against their buttons. its braindead.
if that isnt bad enough.
the devs dont know. or care about character balance.
arcsys in its entire history has never made a balanced fighting game.
ever.
not once.
at least snk and capcom have SF2HF and KOFUM to show off a well balanced game.
arcsys has never achieved this.
i dont think they even know how...since theyve never done it before.
maybe thats the problem. they just dont know how.

lastly,
i can clearly see. that arcsys, instead of balancing this game.
only care about money.
because every new DLC character they release, is literally more broken than the last.
the only thing more broken and overpowered than GT Goku season 2....is UI Goku season 3.
ughhhhhhhh.
disgusting.
and i know why.
why they keep releasing more and more broken DLC characters.
MONEY.
they know way more chance for players to buy a broken op S tier character than a nuetered gimpy C or D tier character.
because of course people wont ybuyb a low tier character.",1548909908,1596792927,FALSE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,178,60,90538,2680,6077,1602068607

Animation is incredible, voice acting (both English and Japanese) are practically spot on to the Anime, has an incredible original OST and also features some OST from the Anime, moves and animations for the characters come straight from the manga and anime.

DBFZ is focused on memorization of ""flashy"" combinations which can be long and repetitive. I feel that it takes the fun out of the game when one side dominates an entire match after one hit because of juggling. 


I like being able to think on my feet, watching for patterns, adjusting my attack and exploiting a weakness.  

It gets fun and exciting to me when you don't know whats going to happen in a match. I enjoy it when both players stand up out of their chairs because it stopped being about ""memorization"" or combos and it became a literal boxing match and you have to think and react to whats going on. It is an Adrenaline Rush.   

You will never see a boxing match ""IRL"" where someone is able to hit another person 20 times in a row and the other person is just standing there taking the hits.   

Review the DBZ fight between Piccolo and Android 17 where both sides are slugging it out.

53927059,english,"Imagine this: It is 2018 and Dragon Ball Z fighting games were always very simple. 2 attack buttons, Ki button, and no command inputs. It was like that for a long time. That all changed when Arc System, mainly the Guilty Gear devs, came in and made this game. It completely changes Dragon Ball Z fighting games and makes it play like the older games, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, we will get there very soon. We just want to see if Bandai publishing this game was a good idea (it was).

Story: This game has a story, and I will use the story from the mode. In the 3 playable arcs, the main story is about a new Android named Android 21, who is a female android with the appearance of a Majin race. The 3 arcs are about the Z Fighters and new allies teaming up to fight this threat. Plus, clones are appearing and wreaking havok and energy waves are weakening the fighters, so links have to be made to regain strength. The script was written by Akira Toriyama himself, so there is some depth to it, but there are flaws, like how the arcs are not arcs, just different perspectives, and how gameplay and story is imbalanced, with lots of plot that can probably be simplified, but hey, it's not all bad, as there are plenty of character interactions that you can get and some pretty funny moments, but I still feel it could be improved, because honestly, the story mode sucks. Besides the interactions, all you do is mop the floor with the same clones that don't play differently from the regular characters. Yeah, there are skills, but most players will just overpower the skills the opponents use and end up getting skills that are much stronger, and there are some poorly written scenes, mainly the Android Arc with seemingly forced deaths. However, I won't spoil, but trust me, you can see the forced deaths when they happen, but feel free to DM me if you are confused about the deaths I am talking about.

Gameplay: Here we go. Forgoing the simple gameplay of previous fighting games, this game takes a lot form Guilty Gear: 3 attack buttons and a unique attack called ""Special"" (for simplicity I will call it the Ki button) and you can use command inputs like QCF for special moves, which is becoming worringly rare these days. The main fighting is set up in a 3v3 style, with the ability to call assists, both characters as well, making for some hectic games. Learning combos is very fun and simple, yet, challenging for the more dynamic combos, and while beginners can still have fun with the simple combos and auto-combo, more experienced players can make longer combos and take advantage of the auto-combo system which can get crazy. Have a character or 2 down? Use your Sparking, which buffs you in many ways as a sort of comeback mechanic, or you can get the Dragon Balls by doing combos or auto-combos, summon Shenron, and make a wish. That is crazy, and the hectic gameplay makes it fun!

Online: The main focus of this game is the online with all the modes. You have the standard ranked and casual, as well as ring matches to help play with friends, and Arena, which is just another Casual match. What is new is a party mode which allows up to 6 players at once in a fight in the 3v3 format. Teamwork is key.... or just carry the entire team, whatever works. There are also special boss events where 3 players can fight a boss character for rewards, and they can get pretty fun. Unfortunately, the netcode is terrible. Despite rollback being what all fighting games should go for, ArcSys stayed in the past and used delay based netcode, causing 7 frame delays to be a standard playing the game. Also, no crossplay either. 3 seasons in and ArcSys showed no interest in changing this. However, one thing that heavily damages online is the rage quitters. especially on PC. For some reason, Arc System just won't punish rage quitters, causing them to multiply! They even rage quit when you are not in ranked. Ouch. The only thing to not run into a rage quitter is through settings or checking their square, and the game tells you complete jack about the squares. Honestly they need to punish rage quitters, every other game does that. Smash Ultimate, Street Fighter V Arcade Edition, Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite, and so much more. Get on it, Arc System!

Graphics and Presentation: Wow this game! This game uses a similar technique found in Guilty Gear, mainly the newer ones with animations and bone structures that emulate the animations of an anime, and they look great! They look so smooth and the cel-shading also looks great! There is even some battle damage implemented, but not too crazy. Just some scars, and armor cracks, but still a neat detail. I think more fighting games should have a battle damage feature. However, the backgrounds do not have this same style and look a little out of place, but they are destructible, so that makes up for it. You can also tell that Arc System were huge Dragon Ball fans through the character interactions through win quotes and even quotes mid match. They even include finishers called ""Dramatic Finishes"" activated by pressing Heavy (or Vanish if you use Freezer) which references moments in the show and a few what-is moments. And yes, you can Yamcha Yamcha.

Sound and Soundtrack: It's a broken record with Dragon Ball Z games and I won't have it any other way: Just use the sounds from the show. They sound great and fit well. You can't beat these sounds. Meanwhile, the OST is also pretty good in certain parts. It feels overpowered by the sound effects though, but what I heard is still good and catchy, even if Hit's theme is so unfitting.

Replayability: It's an online based game. 'Nuff said.

Final Thoughts: This game is great. Great gameplay, mostly great online, great graphics, awesome sounds, good music, it has it all. But what rating would I give it? My opinion, blah, I think this game gets an 8/10 with a side of Super Saiyan 4- oh that was retconned and people hated GT.... Well, the game is still good and I heavily recommend it. If you are more of a console gamer, the game is on PS4 (my OG place for playing the game), XBOX ONE, and Nintendo Switch (which came out later).

Intro
Dragon Ball FighterZ is extremely well made compared to other new traditional fighters. The huge array of familiar and not characters from across the series, (cannon or not) always gives you something new to try. The tag-team element, (while not new) plays extremely well into the familiar fighting game setting we are used to seeing. The combat is smooth and like just about every fighting title has its split second strategies with combo's, guard breaks and just about anything you can think of. 

Characters
The game has a standard pricing to begin with and starts you with hefty amount of characters to begin with. The characters is the biggest downside though. Over 1 third of the character pool is locked behind DLC and while not completely game breaking, does limit your choice and variety, especially since the newer characters (especially fighters pass 3), seem to be a bit more powerful than others. No good game comes without balancing and Bandai Namco are doing so with every update, often dramatically shifting the meta each time. They just seem a tad slow with it. The game is easy to pick up and hard to master. You'll always find some new technique or move to try in your next battle. Especially since some characters get unique conditional moves. 

Detail and animation
The animation quality is beautiful. Everything is in the higher definition movie quality like DBS: Broly and it just makes the game look like you are playing a movie. The attention to detail is very filled as well. Pairing characters on certain maps will trigger stunning beginning and end cutscenes that leave ready for the fight to continue. Map changing after certain finishers is also a nice touch.

Hardware
The game for the most part is easy to run, though you may need to sacrifice some graphics for low end machines. I write this review on a school grade laptop with an intel i-9500 with 2.0 Ghz processor and it runs a stable 60 on minimum settings. Machines with 1080-TI's or higher will EASILY get the most out of the graphics and run smoothly. Online games do exist but servers do not exist in Oceana (Australia/New Zealand). The nearest being Singapore. There is still plenty to do offline. 

Overall, DB FighterZ is a solid modern fighter with plenty to do both on and offline where it's only drawback is price, setting you back a little over $210 AUD to get the ultimate edition + fighters pass 2 & 3. The requirements aren't fierce and will easily run on medium end machines on max settings.

43416640,english,"I have been playing fighting games for over 20 years, competing in national tournaments when I was younger. These days, I'm more of a casual player, preferring Smash Bros over typical fighting games since typical fighting games are harder to get into (you need to spend a lot of time learning moves, practicing, etc.). I'm also a huge fan of Dragon Ball. I've been reading Dragon Ball since Goku and I were both just kids. I grew up with Dragon Ball and it has affected my life in positive ways.

As a fan of Dragon Ball and fighting games, I love this game.

As a fighting game, the game is fun and very easy to start. Even if you're new to fighting games, the training mode is very helpful for starters. The game's auto combos are also great for new players. Once you get familiar with the game and want more advanced tactics, there's plenty here to keep you interested. There's really no reason any Dragon Ball fan new to fighting games should be afraid to give this a start.

As a Dragon Ball game, this game is a love letter to Dragon Ball fans. Hardcore Dragon Ball fans will immediately recognize that many of the basic moves used by characters are actually taken straight from the series. One of Krillin's kicks is a kick he used against Goku during a tournament (when they were kids). Freeza's elbow attack is the one he used against Goku. Likewise, the elbow attack Goku uses is the one he used against Freeza. The game is loaded with these. :D While the story mode isn't great, it has many references to the series and has many interesting interactions between characters in a ""what if"" situation (like Nappa being upset with Vegeta for obvious reason). Watching these scenes made me all giddy.

Overall, this is an excellent Dragon Ball game that no fan of Dragon Ball should miss.

Pros: 1.Any Dragon Ball Z game will sell
         2. I get to play as Trunks.
         3.  combat system actually exists and its very unique

cons: 1. You have to play the game the game the way THEY want you to play it. 
          there is no fun creative days where you try to win without punching, or assists, or pressing
          a certain player
        2. Unlike most fighting games all the skilled players spam super saiyan blue characters. Usually in fighting games once 
        you get good you want to beat people with Sakura and the bear from Tekken. 
        3. Youll be reminded everyday you didnt buy this game the first day it came out. Because the combat system is SO TIGHT, you have very few chances to breath, think, or play around. You will at all times be pressing a button. Not even a milli second will go by. 
       4. There is no sliding to the side, shadow clone jutsu, or a move to give you space. Just beam canons and kamemehas while you flail in the air.

Its a great game but not many of us have time to close the extremely wide skill gap in this game. Unless you bought it day one and have been playing it ever since your time here till be short lived. So many more games coming soon. It's not worth getting absolutely blasted by gogeta online by a kid with 300+ hours of play time and could care less about scaring away new people. Good game though.

72535532,english,"First of all, I love fighting games of any kind, I am a Mortal Kombat Fan from the beginnings, love the way Dragon Ball Super reanimated the series, but bro, this game got me off guard. 
I played the 2018 version of this game and it was like Meh another Budokai Tenkaichi wanna be. BUT when I buy it and play it full this year. GOD this game is the BEST FIGHTING GAME I've played. 

Pros:
-Epic Battles, every single one is Unique.
-Lots of characters (40 up to this date).
-Epic auto balancing feature that a few fighting games implemented, you can really win a fight that is already lost (1 vs 3 situation).
-Every character is balanced and unique, the moveset of any of those are full of references.
-Easy to catch a Fight for a newbie and Hard to master.
-Talking about moveset the way you can counter every single action in this game is insane, you can be very creative with your fight style.
-Ranked matchmaking (To improve your moves).
-Very active community.
-3 vs 3 fights with your friends is FUN. 

Cons:
-Lack of a good Netcode like GGPO(When I play brawlhalla I don't feel lag with my friends), but hey is not that bad only you can feel it with some friends, I can say like 1 of 10 Fights(every single one with a random) you will feel a little laggy.
-Lack of Alternative Costumes for every Character and more coop events with your friends.
-Lack of an easy way to host a Tournament on the Game with your friends. But you can fix this with discord and a Bracket Generator online.
-Some combos in the game are broken and you can kill another character with one fist. I wish this will be fix with some damage cap at 60% in one combo or something, because is very frustrating for some fights. 

if you want a number for me this game is a 10/10, no matter what.

Hope you like my review :3

72268526,english,"Excellent visuals, tight controls, relatively simple for beginners to pick up, and good game balance make this an excellent game to get into. Very faithful to the source material; it's obvious a lot of love and effort went into polishing this game. The DLC, while expensive, isn't necessary to build a strong competitive team, though the characters are actually worth the money if you enjoy those characters, but if you don't play them then there's no point unless you want to set up defending against them in training mode.But, there is an elephant in the room I have to address for anyone looking to get into it. The biggest downsides are the complete lack of crossplay and the delay based netcode which can make actually finding games frustrating and tedious, sometimes impossible depending on the times. Best if you have friends to play this with or you might have a tough time keeping on with it.

As beginners especially you'll probably have a really hard time with matchmaking at first because casual does not have any hidden MMR, so you'll likely get utterly curbstomped by people with hundreds to thousands of games played on your first couple rounds- ranked is actually better at matchmaking when you're a novice. You may have trouble with autocombo and superdash spammers too at first, but all you have to do is be patient and block until they do something unsafe, watch for their superdash and anti air them, and/or call an assist to lock them down and start your own offense. That alone should be enough to get you into the 400-500k BP range. 

Has a fairly active and chill community on the character discords so resources aren't too hard to find, usually.

72181997,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ somehow fits all of my favorite Dragon Ball Characters within a singular fighting game, saying ""no"" to canon. These characters include Goku, a Saiyan who was sent from the planet Vegeta to Earth, Goku, a Saiyan who surpassed the limits of a normal Saiyan, Goku, a Saiyan that unlocked an ancient technique that separates the consciousness from the body, Goku, a Saiyan that unlocked an even stronger version of a divine form, and Yamcha.

The game manages to be simple while keeping the depth that is prominent in most fighting games.
If you don't understand what I mean by that, I'm saying the game has several tools that help people new to fighting games, including:

-Auto Combos
-Combos to be started off of pretty much any hit
-A Super Dash that makes you go through most projectiles while helping you approach
-Most characters having similar combo trees 
etc.

This allows for people to focus on working on mastering basic skills in a fighting game, like knowing when to throw an attack, or how to defend, or how to punish, or how to adapt, or whatever. For people who are wary of flat game without any long combos, you don't have to worry, as there are some mechanics that you can utilize to make your experience more fun, like the use of  assists, teleport cancels, and sparking to extend combos.

Going back to what I said before, the Dragon Ball FighterZ puts as much fanservice as possible, seen within the various supers that recreate entire scenes from the anime, or the interaction of certain characters in story mode that never actually met in the original manga/anime.



Now for an important question:
Is Dragon Ball FighterZ a good game?

Well, the answer to that question is:


Fuck no, the game runs on shitty-ass delay based netcode, makes me drop all my damn combos, I fucking hate this shit.

72086379,english,"Dragonball FighterZ is an incredibly explosive and fun fighting game... bogged down by some stubbornness or lack of time on the developers' part regarding the online play.

This game is one of my favorite examples of how a fighting game can be accessible while managing to work as a competitive game. The auto combos is certainly too good on some characters BUT it is still well-integrated into the game as new players can use them as a stepping stone to learn more advanced combos. 

In contrast to other games where they're usually an ""easy mode"" function, in FighterZ high level players can integrate them as part of larger combos and setups. 

The roster is somewhat bogged down by how similar a lot of the characters play and how a lot of the more interesting characters are hidden behind DLC, but each character still has their own tech. Perhaps thanks to how similar the character are the characters are quite balanced right now, with the lower tiers only needing a few adjustments down the line to become good, and even now they're still playable. 

Matches are very high energy and chaotic, capturing the feel of the show even if it doesn't try to simulate the show's mechanics as much as other DBZ games. Though, still, if you don't like games where you're going to have to defend against long blockstrings or get hit combos that take massive chunks of your life, it might not be for you.

Story mode isn't anything to get excited about. It has some good moments and very fun character interactions but it just feels like a slog when you're going up against AIs who barely fight back and the story moves on at a crawl.

Online though is an important part of this game that has frustratingly enough not been improved for a long time now. It uses delay-based netcode which is not ideal in itself. However add this on top of DCing in the middle of a match carrying no penalty, and on the flipside no option to forfeit in case an emergency DOES comes up in the middle of a match, makes the online experience feel incomplete. With the Covid-19 situation, offline play is more limited than ever, so we'll have to see if they actually start implementing rollback netcode into this game or not. In general it just feels horrible right now when you get magneted into an auto combo because of lag.

I'd still say that Dragonball FighterZ is a fighting game that's fun at many levels, but you're going to wish the online was better.

41563915,english,"I wanted to do an actual review off this game because I feel like I’ve been with this game enough to truly capitalize on what it struggles in. This is also when EVO 2020 was completely cancelled, which I will mention that it’ll have an impact on this game’s state

To get the positives over with, the game has amazing graphics. It’s easy to run. It’s beginner friendly(I’ll mention this later), and it’s really fun labbing all sorts of possibilities with your team in training mode. In season 3, it’s amazing that there are now more opportunities opened up to change up your team, instead of reflecting off the meta(cough cough season 2). All in all, amazing if you’re a dragon ball fan and worth getting.

But it just ends there. My two biggest gripes about this game.

[Super Dash]: A universal button that has your character homing in on the enemy. This wouldn’t be a problem, if so many people just didn’t press it in scramble situations. Super dash beats almost every option in this game besides 2H(2H stands for down-heavy, and is the universal anti-air). That’s right, super dash is a better whiff punisher than many specials in this game that encourage some sort of approach. The game always has to favor the super dash instead of the legitimate approach. I shouldn’t be able to make a approach just by calling an assist and super dashing which apparently kills off a lot of options. A lot of people wonder why it’s a complaint from me, because they’ll say “Dude just punish it with 2H”. But that’s also part of the problem. You’re essentially punishing your opponent who pressed ONE BUTTON by you pressing ONE BUTTON. Neutral in this game essentially shouldn’t be like that. You have all these tools to yourself as a character and it’s up to you to win it, not just have two people push a single button. Essentially, a lot of potential was thrown out the window due to this.

[Online & The Community]: When you play the game online, it’s usually a very difficult path compared to playing at a local where you can easily learn from others. You have to deal w/ frame delay which will easily encourage mashing from both players. Not to mention, players who make a half-assed effort to win the game through something like superdash or turtling(2H only). You’ll never truly improve facing these players, they act as some sort of roadblock(do you know this game enough to be punishing people who super dash too much?) before you get to actual good players who use a real legitimate strategy in order to win. Always go to a local, if you can. People play offline almost entirely differently and you will have an easier time learning the game. Unfortunately, I hardly went to any locals, but I’ve sank too many hours into this game that it hardly even matters that I learn anymore. Take the opportunity I never had.

And lastly, this game falls into the exact same tech-trap that many other fighting games do, it’s tier lists. No matter what, people will absolutely disregard other characters because they are “inferior” to the top tiers. This is simply untrue because every character brings something to the table in this game—even when it seems that they don’t. You can make every character work in this game. A tier list doesn’t represent how good a character is, but their relevance in the meta and how much they are known.

It doesn’t matter where your favorite character is on a tier list. If you can work around their weaknesses and show off their strengths, people will reconsider placing them differently. You will have everyone’s respect when you bust out some amazing tech no one has seen before at a tournament. 

Blue Vegeta is seen as the season’s current bottom tier, but

Mas queria que vc tivesse noção que sou um grande fã da série animada, porém nunca fui chegado a jogos de luta 2d competitivos. Comprei esse jogo somente por ser fã da série e foi isso que abriu as portas para que eu realmente me apaixonasse por esse gênero de jogo.

Dragonball FighterZ foi um tiro no escuro, eu estava focado na história, que por sinal é o ponto mais fraco desse jogo. Ela consegue ser tão superfícial e repetitiva que eu demorei semanas pra terminar isso somente por conta da preguiça de enfrentar sempre os mesmos clones dos personagens da série, mas a parte onde o jogo brilha é sua acessibilidade. Nunca tinha jogados jogos de luta desse estilo 2d então n sabia o que era um meia lua r1, mas o jogo é super instintivo a ponto de ter auto combos que te ajudam a garantir algum dano ao seu adversário, esses mesmos combos automáticos podem ser feitos manualmente, onde vc pode conseguir mais dano, abrindo mais janelas para combos, quando executado dessa forma manual.

O que me frusta um pouco é um pouco de lag dependendo das partidas que vc escolher jogar, o jogo te deixar escolher com qual oponente lutar, onde um fator mt importante que é mostrado nessa tela de seleção é o ping entre vc e o jogador adversário, vc vai poder decidir se vai jogar com algum lag ou não. Então é algo que é frustante, mas ao mesmo tempo, vc consegue contornar isso em um final de semana quando os servidores estão cheios de players querendo jogar tbm.

Ví alguns bugs de interface acontecendo, porém com o começo da season 3, acho que todos foram consertados. E um amigo meu está tendo um problema aonde a CPU dele está atingindo 100% de uso durante o jogo, sendo que o pc dele tem configs acima do recomendado para o jogo.

71820708,english,"There is a difference between this game and fighting games such as Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Soul Caliber, etc.

The difference is that every character in this game has a backstory that spans 40 years. Established in 1986, Dragon Ball is a long running anime/manga series that really engrosses its audience. Not quite sci-fi, not-quite fantasy and not-quite a Kung Fu action series, Dragon Ball is a niche that nobody could have predicted to be so successful.

And now, we have the ultimate Dragon Ball fighting experience.

Honestly, I feel a lot more connected to the fighters in this game than in any other fighting game. Every move has a backstory. I remember the first time Krillin used his Destructo Disc or the Goku vs Frieza fight. Being able to physically perform these moves feels more satisfying than in any other fighting game.

The game has not one, but THREE different stories to play through.
The game has an online lobby where you can interact with other players and fight.
The game has unique characters with their own moves and dialogue (where you can switch between Japanese and English versions).
The game has an online tournament mode, an established esports scene and local tournaments in major cities around the world.

I'd been prompted by friends to get into Tekken but I was unable to. I'm not much of a fighting game enthusiast myself (although I had enjoyed them since I was about 5 years old). The questions that burned in my head were ""why are these people fighting in the middle of the street with people cheering them on?"" 

There was never an answer to that in games like Tekken. 
In Dragon Ball Fighterz, that question is always answered. 

The interaction between fighters is organic. There's a reason why they fight. There's a reason why YOU play (you're featured in the story of the game). There is a reason for everything in the game. 

If you watch the show, you'll be better equipped to understand what's going on. To a degree, it may be difficult for non-Dragon Ball fans to understand the plot. There are no spoilers for the show, yet you still need to understand who you're fighting to fully grasp WHY you're fighting.

This is a must-have fighting game for any enthusiast. If this game is not in your Steam library, you are missing out.

It has simple enough one button combos which would make you feel like you are doing fancy things, to in-depth combat which you learn as you play the game. The gorgeous visuals and choreography make the game a must play for anyone who likes fighting games. 

The best part though is the practice range, which has so much customisation that it makes life easier for training and practising new fancy combos and tricks. I have not tried the practice range on other fighting games to have a comparative talk on this, but from what I have seen in this game, it is really good. 

And last but not the least, the background music being upbeat, does its work really well as well.

It also has a story mode which many might not appreciate, especially since you need to beat that to get one of the characters playable. The story isn't anything to write home about, but for newbies to fighting games, it provides good practice before you get to delve into the actual game.",1593464449,1593464646,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,616,10,3136,0,2993,1593824697

57373275,english,"I LOVE this game, really! (As you can see by my total hours of gameplay). To the point that it is painful for me to make a bad review of it, but on the following lines I'll explain my point of view.

Let's start with the good things:
[list]
[*] superb graphics & animations;
[*] funny & deep gameplay;
[*] good tutorial (although not exhaustive of the mechanics of the game) & useful combo challenges for every character; 
[*] excellent roster (only including also the DLC extra Characters).
[/list]

So, why a bad review? Cause of the following elements:
[list]
[*] [i] mediocre server stability [/i]: QUITE OFTEN, the multiplayer suffers LAG or the Internet connection to the servers falls;
[*] [i] technical issues [/i]: [strike] the UE4 (the game graphic engine) produces random crashes, & (quite often) a DRAMATIC DROP OF FRAMERATE. This happens both in single player & (a lot more) in Ranked Matches [/strike] (FIXED);
[*] [i] the online community: you won't find a fair play [/i], cause most of the people playing this title are combo machines that destroy you with 2 or 3 comboes. In the end, who wins online is the person with the best Controller or Joystic, & not the smarter (as it should be, for me). Actually, I have reached a medium-high level in Ranked matches (I am a ""Demon"") &, although I won 50% of matches in the past (without LAG and FRAMERATE DROPS it would have been at least 60%), at this point I am losing 90% of them cause of the frustrating, foolish, air comboes of my opponents. The basic concept that I don't like is that 90% of the results of a match are determined by those (impossible to stop, when started) air comboes. To make the combat system more fair, in my opinion Arc System should allow only 1 ""cancel jump"" per combo. 
[/list]

EDIT: 29/06/2020: as it is now that the technical issues have been fixed, my advice is to buy for sure this title if you are interested only in single player contents (but considering that they aren't  so many) & to think twice if you want to fight in multiplayer matches. If only was possible on Steam, I would rank this title with a ""medium"" evaluation.

Yup it has awesome 3D anime graphics! The game is noob friendly and is easy to pick up. After playing for a bit it looks like it has some harder to make combos. Although I suspect it may not be a in-depth as lets say Street fighter or a Guilty Gears game, but I could be wrong.   There are multiple game mode like an online hub, tournaments, story mode, VS just to name a few.

I dont even know why its 3 character system when you can master 1 dude and use the other 2 as cannon fodder you use to heal up. Strategy is simple, wait for a single mistake of the opponent and then dish out a combo which takes 80% of the opponents health. That would be fine, it takes a lot of skill to learn this but there is one major problem, there is no way to interrupt combos. Did they ever seen Killer Instinct? Thats how you balance a game like this, with combo breakers. Also, controls feel weird and unresponsive most of the time. You try to do a combo, nope, half a second too late or early on input. You cant even easily learn the timings if you want. Training mode provides you with a list of buttons to press but never when to press them. Its not even showing what are you pressing, which is a standard thing in fighting games training modes. Some combos are just rapid presses, other require a certain delay to wait for animations or enemy to be in a perfect position. Finding the sweet spot is just luck. At the end of the day, if you have lots of time and patience, when you master that one 85+ hit combo you can juggle newbies for days because when they make 1 mistake, its over, and they cant recover from this without a combo breaker mechanic.

Would definitely not pay full 60 Euros for it though.

Bought 1 DLC with Videl because I just love the character, so far it seems like DLC characters can ONLY be used in free-play and not in important game-modes like Xenoverse allowed. (Which was always quite cool.)


One thing I will complain about tho.
No matter what language you put your game, Android 21's voice just sounds soooo horrible that I end up skipping entire dialogs just to avoid hearing it. 
Who came up with the idea ""Hey let's have a 13 year old voice act for the main enemy in the game, it's gonna be epic!""

If the game gives you a Fatal Error UE4 RED when you try to launch the game, it's because it doesn't like the graphics settings.  For me, Windowed Fullscreen caused it to bug out, I have to use regular Fullscreen to have it work all the time.  To get back in the game though:

1) Right click on DBFZ game in Steam, then go to Properties, then Set Launch Options.
2) Type -fullscreen or -windowed to force game to boot different than what you had it set to.  
3) Start the game, go to Options and change your Resolution type and size to what you'd prefer, I recommend regular Fullscreen since tabbing out seems smooth anyways.  
4) Exit game, go back to Steam's Launch Options and remove the command you typed in.  
5) Launch game as normal again and everything should be back to normal.

TL;DR
Dragon Ball FighterZ took some time for me to learn and took some time to really start enjoying. Once I got over the learning curve and the unhelpful design choices, however, I've really sunk my teeth into this game. It's the first tag-battle fighting game I've been excited to keep playing in a long time. It's stylish, fast-paced, and true to the source material that caters to the DBZ fan buried deep within me. The annoying design choices, lame lobby system, uninspired soundtrack, and the problematic netcode are all unfortunate detractors of the experience.

No spoilers but its not the generic folliow the team through the series story its a brand new story just for this game (non cannon obviously just like the movies and dbx1 and 2) One thing I would say is wait for the fighter packs to go on sale if you are only new to buying the game, its just as fun without all the new fighters and its definitely not worth paying full price for the dlc when its on special throughout most of the steam sales! 

BUT if you can't wait some of the newer characters are very fun! just whatever you do buy the packs dont buy them individually unless you never ever plan on buying anymore otherwise you are just wasting your money.

Also one more thing to mention this game has in game curreny with heavy RNG, [b]BUT[/b] there is no way to buy that in game currency outside of the game you have to play to earn it, you are given some for some events and for having some dlc if I remember correctly could be completely wrong here, but you definitely cannot buy it outside of the game which is awesome cause this guys could be cashing in and they are not!",1592733852,1592733852,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,376,7,3463,0,3258,1600613836

Easily one of the most incredible looking games I've ever seen.  I'm not even real sure how they're doing it; some sort of next level cell shading combined with...black magic?  You're watching a cartoon that you're also playing in.  There are a few other titles out there that try to achieve this effect, but they are nowhere even close.  I haven't seen anything this visually groundbreaking in over a decade.

I wouldn't call it a proper competitive fighter though.  The fighting is wildly chaotic, and it's often a bit hard to even figure out where your guy is with all the absurdly huge explosions.  Definitely more the madness of Smash Bros. than the refinement of Tekken.  It in no way detracts from the fun, but you wouldn't want to bet money on an outcome, as a good bit of button mashing will beat even the best technique.

I would say, it's an amazing entry title for newcomers, and also a very good title for veterans who enjoy team-fighters (like MVC, CVS, Skullgirls and such).

The bad?
The online experience is sub-par (as with pretty much every single fighting game out there). The online community is not as huge as the PS4 version. There are some tricky characters that you might think look cool, but are a pain to learn (still not as hard as with other games).

its just basic dbz story telling like it it in the show, and so if anyone has seen the show you know what i mean. the fighting is fun in story mode and it has a budokia 2 feel to it. in which i mean by how you move around in story mode.

the single player of the game is solid though. character choices are cool, and with some worth dlc characters
to fight with as well. i would wait for fighters to go on sale to buy, and they frequently do. but they are worth the addition to the game. the AI can be tough and easy just depends on what you are playing and at what difficulty. overall on how you collect items for things in the room you go is pretty vast. there is also several single player modes to play.

now for online. man ppl have played to much mvc3 bc basically the fight style and 3v3 works like that game.
i had played it alot myself back in the day of its release and was a fantastic game at its time. but playing ppl online can be very difficult and detouring. they are hard and use all based characters ablities that either you burn up all you energy attempting to dodge to get some hits in. or you just get but straight whooped and be ok why did i do that.

overall the game is good. single player solid can become repeative, but the AI can teach you things you have never thought of lol. but online is just a nightmare unless you research combos with 3v3 and go practice you are not really gonna get anywhere. but the game does have friendly match system in reception area where you battle others with out having to que up if you can find a busy enough server to do that with.",1592248288,1592248288,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,217,9,7409,0,4307,1599887639

The single player content is a bit lackluster, the story mode is a tedious, and the tutorials aren't altogether conducive to helping new players grow more accustomed to mid-high level play.

70301467,english,"WARNING: This only applies from A.) My experience and B.) Playing at a Middle-ish level of play

I love this game so goddamn much, and have played an ungodly amount of hours across all platforms, and for me is easily the best Versus style game out there, especially with the new additions from Season 3. However, even with this probably being my favorite fighting game ever, I absolutely cannot recommend it in its current state, especially to newcomers.

I want to start out with some positives. This game, in theory, is very friendly to newcomers. Combos have a very simple structure, letting new players easily learn the execution for higher level play, deemphasizing new players mashing auto-combos. All of the characters are well put together and stay true to the show and manga. This seal of quality is especially apparent in the DLC, paying brilliant homage to the characters in almost every move. Every character is well balanced, and while there is a very apparent meta, it is still very possible to win with the worst of the roster with Jiren, Krillin, and Videl being among them.  Figuring out combos and what your team can do is some of the most fun you can have in the game, making you feel like the smartest person in the world when you figure out some weird combo that only your team can do.

However it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I’ll start with the least concerning problem first. This being a versus game it has the expected broken characters. Almost all of the Gokus are among the best in the game. While all of the assists can be utilized (except maybe Krillin’s A assist) there are assists that are way way way waaaaayyy better than the others. DBS Broly is a good example, his A and B assists are good, however his C assist is obviously the best as it doubles as a beam assist and standard C assist. This is to be expected as it is a versus game, however this can be very annoying especially to newcomers of versus games.

However, what is less forgivable is Bandai selling DLC characters that arguably should have been in the game since it first released back in 2018. base Goku and base Vegeta should have been in the game from the beginning, but no, we’ll sell them for 5$ a piece. Other characters like Jiren and DBZ Broly also fall into this category. Now, I am an idiot consumer who will buy into this because I love this game, however this is a big turn off for many people I know, and Bandai and Arc Sys are potentially losing consumers, and a larger community because of this. Another problem with this is that the asking price for only 16, or all of the DLC characters is 80 DOLLARS. This is 20$ more than the asking price for the base game, which is pretty scummy if you ask me.

My last points will be on the biggest problem this game faces, and something that makes me want to quit playing my favorite fighting game ever, the online environment. This game’s community is either very helpful and nice, and will always rematch even if you're low rank, or is extremely toxic and will rage quit if you land two combos on them in a row (which is a problem with almost any fighting game, however I have noticed it in this game more which could easily because of my playtime across all platforms). All of the best characters are substantially better online thanks to some of the worst netcode in modern day AAA fighting games. What is even worse is that Arc Sys hasn’t done anything to fix it or even make it slightly better. And when indie devs are making better netcode in games like Skullgirls and Them's Fightin’ Herds than you, a Triple A dev, somethings wrong. And hey, remember what I said about the game’s good simple combo structure deemphasizes new players mashing their face against the X button? Well I actually lied. In the online environment you will find high ranking players with Pink and Red squares playing Vegito and mashing their face against the controller. Now this is reactable, as you can block almost anything with enough practice, and they won’t be safe forever as they will lose their assists eventually, however my friends were immediately turned off by the terrible online, and feeling hopelessly outmatched thanks to a terrible matchmaking system.

I love this game so much for being the game that got me into fighting games, as an amazing homage to the original material, and having fantastic balance and really fun mechanics, however 2 years of putting up with this games bullshit, and 2 years of putting up with Arc Sys and Bandai making mistake after mistake, creating overpowered or disappointing characters and doing nothing about it has led me to now where I am actively being discouraged to play it. I hope a brighter future or sequel comes for this game, but for now I am constantly saddened by this game's competitive balance.

The game takes place sometime between ""Universe 6"" and ""Future Trunks"" arcs of Dragon Ball Super. The game's main antagonist, Android 21 (or later, her evil-half), was a normal human who eventually became an Android created by the Red Ribbon Army after her son became the model for Android 16. Once she awakens, she repairs 16 and uses the Dragon Balls to resurrect Frieza, Cell, Nappa, and the Ginyu Force, and seals away the powers and souls of all of Earth's strongest warriors. Wanting to control the hungry monster within her, she and 16 develop a linking system originally created by Dr. Gero in which a human soul (the player) can possess the warriors and provide them strength.

      ●There are 3 Arc's in Dragon Ball FighterZ
 
           ● Super Warrior Arc

      This is the first Arc of the game, and in it we play the role of the “player's soul.” After “possessing” Goku, we wake up to Bulma, according to whom Goku has amnesia. After a short further explanation of what is happening, you go in search of your comrades to create a strong team with which to defeat the main villain in this Arc - Android 21.

          ● Enemy Warrior Arc

   In the second Arc you are given the opportunity to ""possess"" the body of an main villain from the anime. You play with it, form a team of villains, and then even make a joint team between villains and heroes to beat Android 21.

          ● Android 21 Arc

This is the last arc, where everything will end once and for all. In it you have the opportunity to play on behalf of Android 18 and also on behalf of the main villain of the previous 2 arc's - Android 21. In it you finally understand many important things about the story and you are given the chance to see her good side. For me personally, she became one of my favorite characters in the game.

        [h1] 🕹️ Gameplay [/h1]

    ● Mechanics    

 You choose 3 characters to fight with. An interesting mechanic in the game is that you can change the other 2 characters at any time, which opens up great opportunities for different combos. You can also call them for ""assist"" while fighting, and this also opens up other possibilities for combos. With all these combo capabilities, the opportunity for world stages and many competitions is actually alive. There is another special mechanic. It's called ""Come on, Shenron!"". To use it, you need to collect the 7 dragon balls, which you can collect through different combinations of strikes. Once activated, this option allows you to choose between several of your ""wishes"": increasing your fighter's strength, reviving a fallen ally, recovering a fighter's health or regenerating health for the rest of the match. Something i don't like is the mechanic for blocking. You can move backwards to block a punch and you have having 3 different types of blocking. The first is to block frontal attacks, the second is to block attacks focused on the bottom of your character, and the third type of blockade is for top attacks. They all come with key combinations involving backwards moving. 

    ● Ai's
 
Let me explain to you how things are with AIs. When you launch the game and activate the story mode, you can start only with ""normal"" difficulty, which I find a bit boring. In the first arc, the AIs rarely make any punches, in the second they hit from time to time and in the third you can now feel the real feeling of the battle in the game, but not to the point where you need to execute flawless combos in order to defeat them.

    ● Esport and ranked scene 

Above in pros and cons I noted that the game has a developed Esport scene, but there is also a lack of players. Let me explain these words of mine. The game already has a world championship, which is being held for 3 years in a row. There are other tournaments that I am not familiar with. You are probably wondering how there are world championships, but there are no players? I was also wondering that. From my personal observations I noticed that there are 20 people in the servers and they are all already developed players in this game. When you let matchmaking look for people of your caliber, you upload for an indescribably long time, and if you accidentally find someone for one game, then it happens that you play against both the next and the next round against him because are no other newbies. From these personal observations, I came to the conclusion that there is simply a lack of players and all that is left in the game are people who have already developed some higher skill level.


        [h1]📊 Difficulty [/h1]

     The game can be as difficult as you want. The game has many difficulty settings for the story and arcade modes, on top of fighting ranked online if you're looking for a bigger challenge.

       [h1] 🎼 Soundtrack [/h1]
       
     The music in Dragon Ball FighterZ was composed by:

          ● Toshiyuki Kishi
          ● Hiromi Mizutani
          ● Kenji Katoh Reno

    The music is themed for fighting games. It fits well into the atmosphere and definitely moves the game. Each character in the game has a themed song and each arena has its own song. Separately, we have intro, main, lobby and loading songs, and to top it all off, Bandai offers you 2 anime song DLC's that you can buy, but not at the small price of $ 14.99 USD. (Note, gameplay recording will be blocked when these songs are playing due to copyright issues.)

       [h1] 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Target audience [/h1]

     The game focuses on people who like anime and mainly on Dragon Ball fans. It is also focused on people who love 2D fighting games with Esport scene.

     [h1]  💯 Performance [/h1]

   The game is not very strenuous and can easily be played on machines that are not as strong. I think you can easily play it on maximum graphics with GEFORCE GTX 1060, not to mention weaker than that. I have not encountered any problems with FPS and I have not had any drops. I dare to say that the game is well optimized.

Tested with the following setup:
     [table]
     [tr]
         [th]CPU[/th]
         [th]GPU[/th]
         [th]RAM[/th]

        [td]2x8GB[/td]
     [/tr]
     [/table]

      [h1] 💻 Graphics / Art-style [/h1]

     Well, the game's graphics don't need RTX 2080 to see their full potential. As an anime-based game that has to stick to a certain visual, this game makes it great. The visuals definitely gives you that fighting game vibe and is aesthetically pleasing. There are great effects as well, which I was able to fully enjoy.

      [h1]📋 Conclusion[/h1]
  
    I will definitely recommend you this game because it is actually worth it but since it's a game from 2018, just wait for a sale. She is getting a lot of big sales.

70076002,english,I would totally recommend this game due to how the game compliments new players and advanced players to fighting games. The technical stuff is great for experimentation in the training mode and helped me to discover hidden functions with certain characters through their combo trials. This is my all time favorite game due to the fact that it is Dragon ball and more along with movie and series based characters. Also the graphics are amazing in EVERY sense. It makes me want to learn how to play fighting games in general with all of the sophisticated uses of each character in this game. Soundtrack to this game is top of the line in my opinion as well as the movie and story references throughout the game. The story is of a good quality but it has it's downsides but overall was a neat Idea for a dragon ball game. Android 21 is waifu for laifu as well :).,1590896055,1590896055,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,63,12,7122,438,3126,1602009278

- No in-fight transformations (why let you transform during fights if they can sell you the transformations, right?)
- No special attacks collisions, or however you wanna call it (remember Dragon Ball Z Super Butouden 3 when you and your opponent shot a special attack at the same time?)
- 10 FPS animations
- Like 20 dialog boxes between the ""Start Game"" menu and the lobby

69409888,english,"One of the only fighting games I care about playing and enjoy playing.
Dragonball FighterZ, Mortal Kombat 11, and Injustice 2 are the only games I particularly love.

Pros:
-The animation and graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Dragon ball has never looked better and incredible till now
-You do get to see some hilarious interactions and roasts from each character. Story mode has alternate scenes for each character on the field.
-Combat is fun, easy to understand, and fun to keep trying out
-3v3 battles with teammates assisting in the battle is crazy good.
-Lots of fan loved characters are in and look great. Gogeta, Vegito, UI Goku, Goku Black, Zamasu, GT Goku, etc.
-Each fighterz pass is worth it. I recommend getting FighterZ Edition then get the Zpass 3 and 2 if needed. 
-It is a new story. Not the same old Freiza arc, Cell Games arc, Androids arc, Buu arc, etc. 
-New Buu race character named Android 21 which seemed to be a favorite for a lot of people
-There are a good amount of mods available on dbfighterz mods site and they make up for the missing transformations or colors we want to see. You can even have SSB turn into MUI instead.

Cons:
-Would be great if there were more costumes and not recolors for characters
-More dramatic finishes would be insane and is lacking
-No SSG characters. Only SSB and SS3 and below. Also SS4 is included and UI Goku is here.
-Story is meh.
-Prices are still pretty steep. I got this on sale so wait till then.

If you're new to fighting games then just give up if you don't no life games. The amount of smurfs at lower ranks makes it near impossible to learn. The tutorials in-game suck ass and barely teach you anything (including the new dojo training). All of the training is incredibly forgettable unless you write everything down. Since the training in-game is terrible, youtube is pretty much the only source of knowledge and even then, it's hard to grasp everything (idk maybe im just stupid). Trying to learn combos is incredibly hard if you don't know the ""fighterz lingo"" and it's ESPECIALLY difficult if you use a ps4 controller. I mean holy shit is it annoying to learn where the xbox controls are on the ps4 controller in-game. I know you can mod the game in order to get ps4 layout but I just didn't put in the time. The season pass and dlc fighters cost way to much. Not worth it in the slightest. I recommend buying one or two characters you like and just stick it out. Don't waste money on the season pass. 

What I like about the game:
The visuals look amazing at all times and the game is not hard to run at all. The moves are flashy, the supers are cinematic, and they knocked the voice lines out of the park. This game is honestly amazing on local play with friends. The amount of fan service they put into the game with all the abilities really is the only thing keeping me from quitting. If you choose to be a spectator rather than a player, this game is one of the most entertaining fighting games to watch in terms of competitive play. 

Summary: In my opinion, the cons outweigh the pros. The game is not newbie friendly because of the smurfs and the only reason you should even consider buying this game is because it's Dragon Ball.",1589657825,1589657825,FALSE,1,0,0.478260875,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,54,3,3804,46,1865,1601141796

This is a completely different game. You get the true 2-D fighting game experience similar to classic arcade fighting games. Sure, at first I was getting wrecked and it was almost impossible for me to play. But after spending some time learning the mechanics of the game, it wasn't so difficult to learn. I am by no means trying to imply I am on a ""professional"" level of playing the game, but I am able to win a couple of ranked matches with all the other great players :)

69144934,english,"Still my favorite game currently out right now. I can't get enough of it. All the characters are fun to play and play against. The strengths and weaknesses of the characters are fairly balanced, especially since you have the option to mix and match different fighters to create a team to match your playstyle. 

A few people like to complain about the balance of the game, but it's just a coping mechanism to make them feel better about losing. In reality, from my experience of playing, I'd say the game is well balanced, especially with the recent patch allowing everyone to play their favorite characters and still compete online. Only thing that is stopping this game from becoming THE best fighting game at the moment is the lack of GGPO for rollback netplay to smoothen the online experience. But if you are playing this game on PC, the online experience is much better than the PS4 online experience. 

The overall gameplay and feel of the game is top notch . And if you are a Dragonball fan, you can easily spot many of the easter eggs and references to the show, which makes the game that much more enjoyable. If you want to play the game competitively, there is a world of resources online (youtube/twitter/twitch) that you can refer to in order to ameliorate your gameplay, the sky's the limit, and even till this day new aspects of the game are being discovered. New characters are still being added to the roster, I’m looking forward to the next DLC (Ultra Instinct Goku) next week. 

100/100 would recommend this game to anyone, especially if you’re trying to get into fighting games. It is very easy to get into but difficult to master.

Update: I play on the PS4 mainly and have about 1500 matches on it.

It's a solid fighting game with mechanics beginners can pick up really easily and very easy combos to learn.

[h1] The Biggie [/h1]

Dragon Ball FighterZ is my favorite Dragon Ball game ever, might be because I really love fighting games, might be because the game looks and feels amazing, but let's talk more.

The overall gameplay is very solid, from vanishes to dragon rushes, there's not a time when DBFZ becomes predictable, however, that does bring some issues.

Let's say you're playing the game, block a move then get hit by Bardock's B Assist, now you have to block for a full minute before your opponent allows you to play again. Now let me make this clear: There is absolutely nothing wrong with having flashy blockstrings you labbed for 30 hours, I just personally think it's really not fun having to sit through 3 cycles of the guy hitting you with assists and mixing you up. Fortunately I suck at blocking and get hit by anything so I generally don't have to sit through everything.

People complain about online a lot, I was born and raised in the 19 frames so it's whatever for me.

My main complaint is DLC prices, gotta hate them.

Overall, solid game, a tad overpriced, not without its issues.

Definetly recommend though.",1589025329,1589025329,TRUE,1,1,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,123,6,9559,875,6569,1601673205

68755023,english,"I bought this game when it first came out, I will be reviewing its game in its current state (Currently we are on Season 3)
I may update this review in the future if there are more user-friendly features or a removal of user-friendlyness in this game.

This game is a fighting game, as such it will have game mechanics that don't inherently make sense and will cause you frustration.
With that out of the way, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game in its current state to anyone who either A) loves Dragon Ball or B) loves fighting games. This game's presentation is absolutely bonkers and does an excellent job recreating Dragon Ball in the Arc-Sys art style, while still retaining the look of Dragon Ball.
The mechanics that this game presents are complex, but the game has a specific mode called ""FighterZ Dojo"" which helps explain all of these mechanics, which makes it very easy for newcomers to learn the game by just playing it instead of watching Youtube videos.
The game also supports various types of playstyle, by allowing the player to pick from 3 assists per character on their team of three. If you want to pressure your opponent? you've got assists for that. Do you want to combo your opponent and deal a lot of damage? You've got assists for that. Do you want to hang back and try to react? We've got assists for that too. The many different types of assists and characters allow for any player to pick up this game and create a team that suits their playstyle.
[spoiler] Yes i understand there is a painful amount of Goku in this game but they all play different, also Dragon Ball's main protagonist is Goku so it makes sense that he is represented the most [/spoiler]

The game's storymode is mediocre, but the team interactions before a match starts are a great way to have genuine fanservice in the game by developing what-if dialogue to be played before a match in story mode starts.

Training mode in this game is very effective, it allows you to not only practice combos, but also practice reactions to the opponents actions by allowing you to record actions. Recording actions is very powerful and key if you want to develop strategies to either protecting yourself or to stay on offense.

Arcade mode is a mode, very simple. You fight enemy AI teams in rapid succession. i do not like the artificial damage increases that you experience when you progress in arcade mode

Tournament of Power mode in the FighterZ Dojo is a fantastic mode that doesn't feature artificial damage scaling, and you get rewarded for playing a variety of characters in that mode with ""Titles"" that are specific to that character. Titles appear on your player card before a match begins, they can say things like ""First to Fighting"" or ""Nervous Around Girls"". Some reference characters directly, like when Vegeta says ""Heh! What Dirty Fireworks!"". 

Online is a bit iffy, but if you have a wired connection and filter what connections you want to see when engaging in matchmaking, you should do well. The reported connection is not your opponent's quality of internet, but instead its the relationship between you and your opponents connection.

Overall, I rate this game a 8/10, it has its flaws and some of the game mechanics do not make sense (super dash is a good example), but if you can get over that, the game provides all the tools you need to have a great time. Online has some quirks too but they can be circumvented

Please be wary of the extensive DLC, there is a lot, and if you want to buy them, please check youtube videos featuring those characters to see if they are worth your dollar. I have bought all the DLC because i just would like as many possibilities as possible when playing, but you may not feel the same.",1588885930,1588885930,TRUE,45,1,0.816328704,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,209,12,66460,822,50671,1601865697

And before we get into this ""this guy didn't play enough to fully critic the game"" stfu and sit down for a second. To get this out of the way, this game has janky hitboxes, a couple of examples is kid buu's down heavy, golden frieza's down heavy, and bardock's down heavy, all of these down heavies have unusual hitboxes that should not be there. Another hit box that seems to be weird as well is Zamasu's heavy, when his enemy is slightly above him no where near his leg, it somehow hits it. But I have good faith that these could be possibly patched. Aside from that the game is fun, I like how each character is different unlike in tenkaichi where all the characters where basically the same.  I do have a few questionable slots of why these characters are here, but this is about how the game plays. Story is alright i guess, it could have been improved. Gameplay is fun, stages are gorgeous looking along with the whole game, ranked and casual can be insanely hard but rewarding.

68638225,english,"Hands down the best fighting game in the world right now, Beautiful art direction, Mechanically sound, And jam packed with little things that fans will love,

Has a respectable base roster, and loads of DLC characters that are made with the same care and attention as the base characters if not more. You could go through a character's move list and find the moment they do that exact same move in the anime. You can tell its made by people who care.

The game itself is beautiful, the effects are spot on, and it feels like playing an anime, which is the part of the reason why people buy Dragon Ball games in the first place. Additionally, in matchups that happened in the series, there will be special dialogue, and in some cases full cutscenes after the fight or 'Dramatic Finishes'

The mechanics are all there, it never gets pretentious with how you input your controls, and it feels natural to play, not precise for the sake of being difficult like other games.  You can actually have a good time picking up the game, and getting better on your own by battling other people, instead of sitting in training mode trying to get consistent enough to do your inputs as well as the game arbitrarily thinks you should have to do them.

So yeah, the game is gorgeous, Dragon Ball fans love it, competitive players love it, casual players love it and I can wholly recommend it to people who think they dislike fighting games, people who are hardcore members of the FGC, Dragon Ball fans, casual players, or people who just want a cool game with cool moves because they want to do cool shit.",1588713290,1588713290,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,46,3,83599,14731,59084,1602083205

Its heavily inspired by Marvel vs Capcom (wich was also golden) and catches the overall Dragonball atmosphere perfectly^^ ArcSys did an amazing job with this. Ignore everyone who hates on this game. This is a solid, non casual, team based fighting game and one of the best DBZ games in general. Hands down the best looking one too. The only thing i didnt like about it was the story mode (who cares about those in fighting games anyway) But u have to complete it to unlock the new character Android 21.

I wanted to try out a new fighting game however when i get loaded into a match against the highest rank in the game It was not fun. I feel if I were placed against people in my skill group it would be fun but getting placed against the highest ranked then infinitely combo'd to where I cannot retaliate just made the game very boring.

39641786,english,"Pros - 

-Visually stunning. Looks almost exactly like the anime w/3D models. Props to Arc System Works for their art direction. 
-Solid cast of characters, especially with the 2 previous season passes + the current new one. 
-Fast paced, team based fighting game. Doesn't feel like a clone of any other 3v3 fighting game. Feels very much like its own thing. 
-Team composition making has improved since season 3. Each character gaining 3 assists allows for near endless team synergy. 
-Simple inputs. If you don't feel like learning a DP motion or charge motion, then all you have to worry about is quarter circles in this game. 
-PC community is fairly active for a fighting game. 
-No microtransactions outside of DLC characters and music. Colors and stages are all free. 
- 3V3 player mode is fun (despite the lag issues it has). 
-Boss battle modes are fun for people into them. Adds a layer of challenge.
- Easy to jump into compared to some fighting games, but hard to master, like most.

Cons
- Story mode is a grind and kinda sucks. Also the only way to unlock Android 21 IF you don't own the season 1 pass. 
- Online is delay based netcode. TLDR, it's not good. Likely will find some pretty laggy matches. 
- Some frustrating mechanics exist, such as superdash. These become even more frustrating when you play online with 3-4+ frames of delay. 
-The games optimization can be hit or miss. Sometimes the game hard crashed on me. There are ways to fix this with some configuration changes though.",1517013312,1587844012,TRUE,1,0,0.500997961,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,77,18,80814,1603,2870,1602014503

67333614,english,"If you are looking for a fighting game to play, this is definitely one to check out.

To preface this review, I had never played a serious fighting game before. I was pretty terrible at them and could not figure out how to do anything cool.

With that said, I have had an absolute blast with this game. I love Dragonball Z and Super, so I was naturally hyped for this game (even though I did not play this type of game). I'll be honest, I was super bad when I first started playing and I did not have a good time while getting my butt handed to me again and again. I even took a 3 month break from the game because I was very frustrated. However, I took the time to find the enjoyment and as you can see at the time of this review (414 hours), I have played this game a lot.

It is a fantastic game when you figure out how to go about playing it. The tutorials have been improved since the game has come out with (with the latest system changes) and all the characters in the game are really good. Season 1 was the base game and you could say the fighters were pretty generic and similar to one another. Season 2 came out and they introduced some interesting gimmicks and characters with fun things to do. Season 3 looks to do more of the same. The tournaments are really good to watch (EVO, etc) and the top players really showcase what the game can do.

The most important thing I can say about this game is the rewarding feeling you get when you master a combo you have been grinding for the past however long. I have felt this many times with all the characters I have played and it feels amazing every time. Don't get me wrong, you have to practice to be good and competent at this game, but it rewards you when you put the time in.

All in all, this is a very solid game. The biggest downfall is the online (delay based). It can be rough at times on PC but is serviceable for the most part. If you like Dragonball, give this a try!",1586914665,1586914665,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,47,1,32586,223,24858,1600996629

67277866,english,"DBFZ has been out for 2 years now and in my opinion, it's in it's most fun state yet. With the recent addition of selectable assists, it's easier than ever to make your dream team work without just being lazy to resort to throwing SSJ Goku in the back for his beam assist or something. It still has loads of depth despite it's more simple control scheme compared to other ArcSys games (I'd argue one of their most deep games in general!) and of course, it looks absolutely gorgeous. The roster is bigger than ever now and it's pretty well balanced too. DBFZ is probably my favorite fighting game of the generation and I still play it almost every chance I get (though I only recently moved onto PC from PS4).

It's biggest downside is it's mediocre average Arcsys delay based netcode. Recently, Arcsys has been interested in putting in good rollback netcode in their upcoming game, GG Strive, but who knows if it'll be good and even if it is, it'll ever be patched in. That being said, it's not unplayable by any means and if you have no other way to train, it's nice to have. 

It's easier than ever to get into these days, especially with the abundance of tutorials online. Sure it's not an easy game, but I believe in you.

67259535,english,"I’m not usually a fighting-game person, but liking shorter games this has ended up as the game I have clocked the most hours into. And for the most part, I’ve enjoyed it. It’s fun and challenging and is a good contrast to other games I like to chill out and play. Even though I’m a noob in fighting games, I wouldn’t call this necessarily beginner friendly. It does try really hard in some areas, it has auto-combos for beginners, and if I had to set a difficulty to it, I suppose it’s easy to learn/hard to master. ArcSys knows that a lot of people probably will try it out because it’s Dragon Ball, so they do try their best.

FighterZ has ran smoothly on my computer for about a year now. Since it’s been a while for me personally to have major issues, I’ll still recommend this game to anyone who knows their computer can run it.

Tutorials: Season 3 has added a lot here, with the FighterZ Dojo and the Tournament of Power competition. It was bare bones before, and no real help for anything besides beginner knowledge. And I would call it useless doing it separately outside the Story Mode, which you’re stuck doing the basics for a while into it. Now, I’ll say all the tutorials together are something substantial and having a character set to be your master is an interesting concept and incentive for someone to complete them. Not my cup of tea, but it’s cool for people who like it.

Training Mode in general: There’s enough variety in what you can look at plus controlling the settings where you can spend hours effectively trying to get better. If you know what you’re doing, this game gives you a lot here to find strategies and teams that work for you. The combo challenges are nice if only so you can get a feel to see what sort of moves go together well for what character.

Story: The story itself is fine, but the pacing for both the story and gameplay is awful. It’s nice that it has that gallery option if you just want to revisit fun interactions and dialogue between the characters. That’s the best part of story mode. Like I said for tutorials, until you unlock hard mode a huge chunk of story is just repeating tutorials and super easy fights. I would only recommend story for Android 21 unlock and zeni grinding, though the ToP challenges in the Dojo eclipse the latter now.

Arcade Mode: I was tired of the same sets of fights, so I almost gave this mode up until it introduced random. Now, I go through it if I want to practice a few matches with a team without deciding what CPU level and teams to fight against. Just fight what the game gives me and roll with it. Not too hard, and I don’t know what the difficulty curve is set to, but it works if I don’t feel like going online. 

Local Battle: I don’t have any friends who play this game, so I can’t comment on its usefulness there. Looks competent. If I do have a specific CPU level I want to try, or just a single character to practice without doing a whole 3v3 battle I use this mode for quick fights.

Online: I only do normal matches, so I can’t comment on the Party Matches or anything that isn’t simply being matched with someone for battle. I don’t know anyone else that plays the game, and I feel party and ring matches are best used among people you know and know your fighting style. I see people unhappy with what matches are offered to them, but for me the longer I’ve had this game the better it is.

New chances: I can set my parameters to good internet connection, high completion rate, and someone around my skill level and have matches lined up. It’s not always great, but I’ll accept a few poor nights of not much compared to my old luck. Old chances: Have to accept all kinds of challengers, with poor internet connection, possible rage-quitters and people way out of my skill level and sometimes still have nothing. Part of it may be that I’m not completely at the bottom of the barrel with skill level now and more people exist that are better at the game and matched with me, yet overall, it’s a huge difference to the first 6 months or so I had at the game.

I won’t discount people who say they have a horrible time finding a match, everyone’s connection story and luck will be different, but for me I haven’t had head-banging problems in a while.

DLC: I paid for all the passes (not including Ultimate), though the first season pass was on sale when I bought it with the game. Disclosure done, I think they’re all okay. I always have at least one DLC character on my team, if not two. I can’t say on what average tier they fall into, not knowledgeable enough on all of them or fighting games, but I can say that none really feel same-y to me, and that’s what I care about when putting extra money on something. Some have similar moves – which is likely to happen with several variety of Saiyans including Goku, Vegeta, Broly and fusions – yet they’re all mixed up in ways where none feel like they have the same exact play style.

Unless you feel it’s worth the investment, I’ll look up videos on characters you’re interested in buying or just go for characters you like, no harm in that. I wouldn’t buy the newest season 3 pass with only [i]hopes[/i] that your favorite character will make it in.

Everything else is true, from the positive to the negative (non stop aggro wins against all). Still loving this game.


This is probably one of the best intro to fighting games you can get. The gameplay itself is great, beautiful and a lot to learn and they way auto combos are implemented lets casuals have their fun and let them dive deeper into the game. The attention to detail for the animations in this game are truly nuts and the characters in this will probably be the best they will ever look in any way. Yes, it most certainly does look better than the anime.

For people already into fighting games, this one is solid but not too deep. You aren't going to see many demanding execution heavy skills in the game but it doesn't detract from the gameplay. About 50% of the cast plays ""the same"" but that is just in combo structure. Normals, specials and such are all unique. The game rewards (slightly) mindless aggression over good neutral, and the lack of push block makes the aggression worse since once they are in they can stay in pretty easily. Also, to add to that, there are very little reversals in this game as well (That is if you don't want to burn meter). Also, once you get to higher levels you will see Snap Back abuse , which basically puts you in a 50/50 in the corner every single time forcing you to guess on what the mix will be with the only counter play being to spark which is a one time use. This also negates tall characters due to ""fuzzies"" (for example Broly, Cell, A16, basically anyone taller than Goku). Some people may like this sort of frantic gameplay but just for fair warning its probably the number one thing I hate about this game.

How I may have  kinda tore into this game a bit it doesn't take away from a single thing about me loving it. Its very satisfying to play fast, learn new tricks and it look stunning while doing it. If you love Dragon Ball and ever wanted to get your toes wet in a fighting game start here. I am sure you won't regret it.

And oh yeah, don't get this for single player content. All fully voiced (ENG/JP) but very boring .

Oh yeah and blocking, forget about it, the net code of the game makes it so even if your blocking they can get through. So you get hit once and get to watch helplessly as your character flies around the screen until they are bloody dead.  Want to try an attack, well even if you put the command perfectly in your controller it will wiff and do an attack that leaves you wide open.

Match start > try to attack > game thinks you want to dragon rush > get hit once > comboed for 80 seconds = lose (over and over)

39922414,english,"[b]Summary:[/b] Buy it if you're a Dragon Ball fan and willing to put in several hours of practice. This blows every other Dragon Ball Z game out of the water. However, this game has less content than other fighters, so I must recommend getting this on sale.

[b]Notes:[/b] The roster size is a popular point of contention (24 chars + 14 DLC chars). Since this roster doesn't seem particularly small or big it's neither a pro or a con. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Treats license well, several references from source material
- Great soundtrack, funny English dub, and decent Japanese dub
- Character unlocks (instead of microtransactions)
- Simple, deep mechanics (though not unique)
- Story mode cut-scenes are ok
- Easy to learn for a fighter
- Runs surprisingly well
- Great Visuals

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Depending on what gamepad you have, you might end up dropping combos regardless of skill, even when using dpad to move.
- Strange lobby system that complicates playing with friends, occasional server disconnects, and outdated delay based netcode
- Weak Single Player: Story mode is padded with repetitive fights between cut-scenes, increasing the time it takes to unlock one of the chars. In addition, there's a lack of standard arcade endings. Devalues this game slightly below the full $60 for general audiences, especially with titles like mortal kombat or injustice in the market.

The visuals in this game are INCREDIBLE, personally I think this is gonna be the pinnacle DB game visually and ArcSys Work's magnum opus for a while (personally I like it more than GBF and GGS).
3v3 Tag Vs. styled gameplay is always a welcome.
Matches with friends are a blast, playing online matchmaking is a mixed bag because of netcode, I'll touch on that later.
The gameplay itself in the game is also fun, a much needed change in DB games, having an actual high level fighter is phenomenal.
The changes added in Season 3 really improved the game for the better, it's much more fresh now.
Incredibly fun to lab in this game, and finding ToD's is satisfying.
Mods are fun too, sucks that you can't play online unless someone else has mods enabled too.
Only downside is online is can be bad, netcode really isn't that great, bad even at some points.

My favorite DB game? Absolutely.

If you look at the math, there's actually many more Gokus in this game than one might expect. Of course, we've got the three main Gokus, but there's also Vegito, who is 0.5 Gokus due to being a fusion with Vegeta. 

Then, we have Gohan, who is half Goku and half Chi-Chi, making him also 0.5 Gokus, so since we have two of him, this brings our current total to 4.5 Gokus. 

We've also got Gotenks. Gotenks is 0.25 Gokus, because he is both a child and a fusion. Now our total is 4.75.

There's also Goku Black. While he has the mind of Zamasu, his body is 100% Goku, making him count as one Goku nonetheless. Fused Zamasu is 50% Goku Black, making him also 0.5 Gokus.

Next, Bardock. Goku is 50% Bardock, which in turn means that Bardock is 200% Goku, making him two whole Gokus. This brings our total to 8.25 Gokus.

Perfect Cell and Android 21 are kinda weird, but according to a commenter Perfect Cell is 0.166 Gokus, and Android 21 is 0.151 Gokus, which brings us to a total of 8.567 Gokus.

With the FighterZ Pass 2 giving us GT Goku and Gogeta, we now have another one and a half Gokus, but the new pass also brings us the Great Saiyaman as part of Videl's moveset, which is another half Goku, bringing the current total number of Gokus to 10.567.

And with FighterZ Pass 3 we will be given yet another Goku, this time in his Ultra Instinct form, which will bring the total to 11.567.",1533829469,1583745544,TRUE,297,775,0.938970387,34,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,315,1,3329,42,2893,1601748825

This is the Dragonbal Fighting game we always wanted. It's as if the two favourite things from my teens came together, Dragonball and Marvel Vs Capcom 2. This game is insanley balanced for what it is and a lot of thought has gone into the combat flow. Combos chain amazingly...and I'm not even considerably good at this game. The character interations and cutscenes are often hilarious insights to the individual characters and how they feel about eachother. Also Android 21 is a good addition to the cast.

Negatives.
The actual plot of the story mode is trash. It's just drivel and everything in it is an excuse to make fights like Yamcha vs Cell an even match. I can't hate them for trying though.

WARNING FANRANT...
There IS a great selection of characters. But What would be great is if they gave certain characters some love. Tien, Although actually has an alright move set has kind of been crapped on (again) He has probably introduced more signiture movesto the series than most individual characters. Why is is one of the only characters that DON'T have the Solar flare?? He invented it! Why does Krillin get mor use out of the multiform...When Tien ALSO invented it! Tien can grow more limbs, did you know that? No? Only watched super? Only watched Z? Watch Dragonball, He has so much more to give...and don't get me started on his finisher. Well, okay, if you insist!!! Why is Ciaotsu killing himself and Tien having a three secon breakdown his ULTIMATE attack??? Even more so, once you have used ityou don't have a finished for him anymore! Waste of a great character. I love Yamcha...but why doesn even HE have better moves than Tien?

Could do with some more obscure characters rather than more versions of the same Saiyans.
Where's Roshi? Wheres Yajirobe? Chi Chi? (More female characters, please! There isn't many in Dragonball, but from what there is please put them in!) Mercenary Tao? Zarbon? Dodoria? Raditz? Ciaotsu would be fun to play as. Personal gripe, but if Krillin can go toe to toe with Janemba (Who isn't even canon either) then I don't see any reason not to include old school characters.
END OF FAN RANT

One last negative...there really isn't a scaling system in place. Every time i play someone online, 9/10 they are insanley good. Like, they have played this game a lot and there is no hope in hell of beating them. So I avoid the online mode like the plague, that place is on another level.

EDIT 2: My game won't launch anymore lol

Keeping this brief cuz I got off-track last time and idc if people want to bicker over specific bullet-points

Pros: 
-Great presentation
-Beginner-friendly, while still complex
-Dragon Ball fanservice extraordinaire
-Great overall game feel
[spoiler]
(Edit: to clarify, these Pros include things like ""The story mode has great cutscenes"" [strike]or ""Matches feel great to play""[/strike] and as you can see by my playtime, they are very wholly and substantially good parts of the experience-- I'm not trying to downplay them with a small list but the cons absolutely get in my way, check my comment for details)
[/spoiler]

Cons:
-ABYSMAL netcode
-Terrible online infrastructure
-Very low playerbase and available matches any time other than patch-day because there's no crossplay
-Lacking and unengaging single-player content
-Awful AI
-Devs seemingly ignoring obvious features to add, like local (or even local/online mixed) Party Match, which is already available on the Switch version, mixed team sizes outside of Local Battle Vs, or even things like Story Mode 'Skills' in versus for example
-Unappealing DLC pricing and release schedules
-Long-standing balance issues that respected the nature of fighting game meta at first, but now just come across as extremely frustrating and disconcerting.  Our last balance patch was in March. It's now mid-October.  Certain characters have been awful since release, while others (mostly DLC) have been great since release.  GT Goku in particular, who released in May, has been the subject of serious talks for getting banned in-tournament, which obviously doesn't apply to modes like ranked.  Fun, right?
-Below 0 mod support, risking players to get banned/dropped from matches for undetermined amounts of time for even offline-only use of custom community content.  Even reinstalls and firewall settings (which are both recommended with mods) sometimes can't avoid you getting a stained account for no good reason. 

Currently, I don't recommend the game to new players, but it wouldn't take much for me to change that. 
The basic grind would be FAR more enjoyable and much more worth it with just a few things fixed at the top of my priority list; 
1- Rollback netcode (GGPO's SDK and license are free now, there is no excuse)
2- Crossplay, to offset low playercounts for PC.  Again, not too hard to do for any company in 2019 that isn't exceedingly stuck-up and willingly ignorant.
3- Easier access to modes and features already in the game, like Party Match and variable team size, so sessions with friends/randoms aren't prone to getting super boring and barebones-feeling

The gameplay is superb with easy to learn combo mechanics for beginners which means you can feel like a badass right out of the gate, but as you master a diverse and balanced cast of characters, the game gives you plenty of combos to learn and strategies to master. The 3 fighter system works great and plays a massive role in online play where your character loadout can make or break you. With Z assists becoming its own massive part in learning the combat system, each character has a special assist move that can be anything from a hard knockdown, a power blast, or a buff that helps your current character. But the real treasure in this game is the art style, its basically if you upgraded an anime into 3d and it totally works, the 3d models look exactly what your mind would render when you think ""hey what does 3d Goku look like"", and this takes the special moves to a whole new level as they are directly inspired by manga panels and feel super authentic.

I am top 100 in the UK on the leaderboard and I find matches almost instantly, the player base is thriving (Except for like 5am on a Sunday) And the game is just overall amazing to get into.

Ignore the idiots calling the netcode bad, they clearly play on a laptop on wifi, against people from my own region I get steady 1-2, I play with someone from the US, East Coast and I only get 5 frames of delay (Which honestly, ain't even that much. It's usually a steady 4 anyways)

this game is not an eyesore by any means. the graphics are colorful, bombastic, and services the game play very well
the music is pretty forgettable honestly. generic rock tracks can be kind of fun the first listen through, but i sort of wish Budokai 3's soundtrack was used more in recent games. 

the fighting in this fighting game is pretty fun honestly. if you don't play 2d fighters like i mostly do you'll find yourself mashing quite a lot, and this ultimately doesn't help because Fighterz rewards your opponents if you make one simple mistake. 

if you take the time to get your ass beat, you can learn from it and have a genuinely good time. i personally have been enjoying the characters of Hit and Frieza quite a lot, because they're good zoners with not bad up close game either. 
the new season 3 changes are awesome. being able to change your assists is huge, because it means people will actually use krillin for his assists now. 
all kidding aside, there are a few problems i do have

for starters, some characters have crouching attacks that are pretty indistinguishable from standing attacks, like DBS Broly and Cooler, and sometimes crouch blocking doesn't even work in DBS Broly's case. the stomp attack generally hits low, but sometimes you just get hit by it even if you block correctly. 

the online can be very frustrating. sometimes it'll run buttery smooth which is great, but then there will be matches that feel like they're playing in slo-motion.

i'm giving this a big recommend, because people that like fighting games will enjoy the Guilty Gear feel of this game, and even more so if they like Dragon Ball.",1582903120,1582903120,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,46,23,4024,0,2555,1598904291

180 hours and 2 years later this game still holds up as one of if not the best fighting games of all time. the dlc improved the roster a ton and dispite how unbalanced gt goku was and still is, all of the dlc fighers were welcome additions and with the addition of new assists for every character, team diversity is at an all time high. the server problems mentioned in my old review have been completely fixed although the game dose crash much more frequently now. my final review for this game is an easy 10/10 but when im fighting gt goku or teen gohan that score goes down to a 1/10 garbage doo doo trash game",1518210775,1582819711,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,195,12,29548,2867,549,1602040273

-Performance is good and consistent. No random frame drops, stutters or crashes throughout my entire playthrough

Bad stuffs:
-Story mode, both gameplay-wise and plot-wise
-Suffers from the greeDLC-syndrome like pretty much most fighting games these recent years and its also way overpriced imo

You can basically do the same BnB with every character. However, once you start experimenting, and start using assists, etc. It can become quite fun. This new season has added a new layer of complexity to the game but without making it feel too bloated. 

Easy inputs, cool supers, and actually, a pretty well balanced roster.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from quite a few things. A really bad, long, and tedious story mode.

64126904,english,"A fun and very accessible fighting game, that still manages to have a lot of skill expression at the upper tiers.

Pros:
-The game allows for beginners to jump right in with only quarter-circle motions for special moves and supers.  Auto-combos are good enough on their own for beginners, but learning how to properly extend combos is required as you climb the ladder.

-The game looks really good, with flashy special moves, giant explosions, and attacks sending opponents flying.

-The latest patch for Season 3 brought a load of improvements.  The standouts include the ability to choose what attack your assists perform when you call them, and new changes around the Dragon Rush (the game's un-blockable attack common to all characters) mechanic making them easier to land.  The UI was also changed and a better (but still incomplete) training mode.

-Overall a good roster of characters (though there are a lot of Goku characters) that play differently enough to have distinct strategies and match-ups, but similar enough that picking up a new character doesn't take very long.

-The Dramatic and Destructive Finish moves are still not old 150 hours in.  Some of the level 3 super moves... might be a bit long to be happening mid-match.  They still look really cool, though.  I honestly feel like I'm watching an anime while playing this game.

Cons: 
-The single-player content is not very good.  While this is common for the genre, ArcSys usually makes games with loads of interesting content for those of us who don't necessarily want to bash our skulls against the ranked ladder.  The story mode is the biggest offender here.  The plot is boring and the gameplay consists of trivial fights against AI opponents that just stand there and let you beat them up.  In the Blazblue series, ArcSys seemed to understand that there need not be 80 - 90 fights in a single story route.  Here, they kind of went off the deep end...  All in all it took me about 6 - 7 hours to finish.

-The training mode is not very good for teaching anything except for the absolute basics of the game.  The newest patch does improve training mode, which is nice, but still your best bet is to take to YouTube and find some of the tutorials posted there.  For instance, in the Combo Challenge mode the final combo for Super Saiyan Goku is actually a very basic combo that most of the characters in the game can do.  The thing is, this combo does not feature in any of the other character's Combo Challenge so I figured it was character specific.  Later on I noticed other players performing the combo with other characters at which point I realized I was missing out on a lot of damage doing Auto-combos or down + heavy launchers instead.

All-in-all, this is a great anime fighting game that has a good trade-off for the hardcore audience vs. the filthy casuals like me.  It's the first fighting game in years that I've actually wanted to make an effort to learn some, and enjoy watching others play.",1582686646,1582686646,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,390,6,18103,35,9048,1601163811

63590139,english,"This is definitely one of the best, if not my favorite, fighting games I've played in a while. Arc System Works makes some top quality anime Fighting games like the recent Granblue Fantasy Versus, Guilty Gear, Under Night In-Birth, and BlazBlue. They do an amazing job at mimicking the Dragon Ball/Akira Toriyama style. Every single animation in this game was taken into account and they all look stunning. All of the characters play really well and feel amazing to control. Finding teams that synergize with each other is also nice thing because it makes you experiment with each of the unique characters and their play styles. The one side that this games falls a little short on is the campaign. It plays almost like the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2 story mode but at the same time a little different. While I will say that the cutscenes, alone, are fun to watch and seeing how everyone interacts with each other in the story is also nice, I just don't think it's something you NEED to play in this game, unless you're going for the Android 21 unlock. Other than the story this game is outstanding in the fighting game world and is must play if you are a fan of Dragon Ball, MvC, or Fighting games in general. Everything is filled with eye-candy here and I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone into Fighting games.

63453634,english,"After pouring hours into the closed and open beta on PS4 then more into the full release on PC, Switch and PS4, I find it hard to believe why people love this game so much. 

I mean, I CAN actually see why, but at the same time I really don't.

Pros:
+ Amazing, hand-drawn, effort-filled animations, art and graphics. Probably one of the biggest eye candy I've ever seen in any game
+ Controls and mechanics are optimized for controller
+ Character interactions, dramatic introductions and finishers, alongside character cast and moveset, are very faithful to Dragon Ball Z/Super and what makes the franchise loved.

Cons:
- Optimization broken beyond belief: One lag spike destroys connection with controller entirely, occasional lag spikes with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with fan boosting and laptop coolpad
- Bad netcode (but not SFV, Smash Bros Ultimate levels of piss-poor)
- Lack of stages
- Balancing: lack of updates (as to one of the reasons why GT Goku is piss-broken) and overly aggro-favored gameplay ruins the balancing factor of this game
- Gameplay itself reward too much aggro-gameplay; little to no defensive options. 
- No variety in assists; Yes, you can extend combos or use them for neutral but assists consist of one attack only, which either boosts or detriments a character badly. Thank f**k they're adding assist variants. 
- Abyssmally boring story mode; nonexistent writing and piss-poor AI 

Personal Grudge (that does not affect my ranking of the game as much as my views on the game):
- The DLC: The fact that Base Goku and Vegeta are DLC and their SSJ1 forms aren't, but even moreso the DLC pool lacking in ideas to the point where we need more Goku variants as DLC than in base game

There are factors I like about this game but many more that I suggest against buying this game. Wait for a sale. At least the community is alive, and even so that's LITERALLY because this game is Dragon Ball and everyone loves to kiss aggro-ass.",1581628185,1581628286,FALSE,3,0,0.47058022,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,771,124,3311,0,2006,1600715629

What i hate about it is that the antagonist is a majin android human who for some reason doesn't need dragon balls to ressurect people from teh dead. I hate that instead of transforming, you have  seperate characters for each transformation.
Instead of giving us 40 original characters, instead we have  (so far) 5 gokus, multiple vegitas, vegito, gogeta.

In any dragon ball game i grew up with ..this would take up 2 character slots. instead it takes up almost 10..with more gokus on the way.

I also don't like the auto combos.
Stop milking your customers and treating them like they are dumb. 
If this was tenkaichi we would have paid for a full game, we would have gotten 100 characters and additional transformations. We would have gottten a complex upgraded combat system.

instead we just got multiple gokus , 3 on 3 auto combo garbage.


I love this game, because it is dragon ball, and has an original story. however in all honesty, I haven't played this in a while, and when I want to play a dragonball game  I will just play budokai or ultimate tenkaichi on my ps3..not this.


too expensive and not much content. Not everyone wants to play fighting games to be competitive. SOme of us just want to play story mode and experience playing with each character. Please make a dragon ball fighting game like you used to. I have spent $300 on this game so far. There are so many gokus it's not even possible to have 2 teams of 3 gokus each..you'd still have 1 or 2 extra gokus..

goku is one character
please return goku to being one character ffs. you have the tech to do it, there was no need to have each transformation of goku take up a whole character slot.  those character slots could have been used for characters that people actually want to play.

This game is insanely well made, it's crazy. All characters are viable, obviously, some are better than others, but that's normal.

On top of all characters being viable, they are gonna get even more viable on February 26th, which is when the first Season 3 Patch releases and will introduce a new mechanic called ""Z Assist Select."" This mechanic will allow you to choose from 3 Assists when you pick a character, so characters that weren't being chosen that much due to not having a good/best assist will now have time to shine. I too, am guilty of this as my most played character is Goku(Super Saiyan) due to the fact that his beam assist, ""Kamehameha,"" is the most versatile assist out there. Now I don't have to choose Goku(Super Saiyan) for his Beam Assist because other characters will also get beam assists/better assists.

This game is also visually stunning, in terms of graphics and the attention to detail in a character's moveset. I don't just mean ""Goku did a Kamehameha in the show, so he has it in the game."" or ""Krillin did Solar Flare in the show, so he has it in the game.""

So far:
No bugs found.
can be a bit laggy if you or your opponent have a bad connection.
Lobbys are full and getting into one in the mean time is not so easy but just keep looking you will get in eventually.
you can get disconnected from the lobby ""probably due to high connection volumes"".
the gameplay is smooth and the controlls can be configured on both controller and keyboard.
some moves can be spammed which hopefully will be adjusted in the future.
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
Kinda expensive
Hopefully creating a lobby will become a feature, as it will help you play with your friends online and not just some randoms THAT SPAM KAMEHAMEHAAA ALL OVER. ""i did manage to get loose but after my life got shit on by spamming""
The game is enjoyable and like all games you will eventually get bored and look for another game to play. IF YOU WANT IT BUY IT ITS A GOOD GAME, BUT IF YOU DONT WANT IT DONT BUY IT AND DONT BITCH ABOUT IT.

63208944,english,"The long short; It's Marvel v Capcom DBZ edition

Well balanced and fast paced, DBFZ presents a 3v3 fighter with plenty of avenues for player expression through the unique fist/ki fighting style and eclectic cast that has made the franchise famous. The cast consists of characters primarily from DragonBall-Z and DragonBall Super, offering a wide variety of move-sets to stylize your beatdown while maintaining enough common threads that make experimenting with other characters accessible and exciting when you've found your rhythm. 
That said, players should spend a good amount of time practicing combos in the practice room, character combo challenges, arcade (PvE), and testing their muscle online as the campaign does not enforce advanced fighting tactics and because of its length can become a repetitive mindless monster mash. The game could continue to introduce advanced tactics to widen the breadth of the player's five-knuckle vocabulary, but leaves a good handful of that duty to the player themselves. Much of the creativity and fun of the game can be lost through mindless mashing repetition, and many online battles can be lost just the same. 
Normally this wouldn't be a downside as it allows new fighters to build familiarity and confidence, but the campaign is just too drawn out to allow so much repetition without pushing the player forward in skill. Frieza even complains about the repetitiveness during the campaign!
DragonBall FighterZ is a great game if you're even a little bit of a fan of DBZ; it offers a beautiful presentation and faithful recreation of many characters and moments from the Z series, on top of being a tense fighter. The campaign is fun and will tickle many nostalgia nerves but feels a bit long for what it gives you in personal personnel punching progress.
FighterZ is the best fighting game with the DragonBall tag on it since planet Vegeta was death-starred to dust and is itself a fun frolic with apt depth for fighter enthusiasts. Jump in, pierce the heavens, and fly away!!

Very good online servers with little ping, on average (for me) 2-5 frame delay on inputs so it's nearly unnoticeable. The supers and specials are cool and fun to use.

Try not to spam super dash to close the gap all the time since it's easily beaten by a 2h or dp leaving your opponent a big opportunity to punish you. (You're still safe to block If you hit their block with your dash.)
Reflect comes out frame 1.

62585057,english,"I recommend you pirate this game, it's a good fighting game.
However, it doesn't run on a lot of computers - and it needs to be run online at least once to be able to access offline.
As such, you don't really own this game, Denuvo and EasyAntiCheat own it.
I couldn't get it to run on my big rig, only on some old laptop running window 10 (and slowly, at that) - running it on that computer did not allow me to run it offline on my big rig, so essentially you pay for nothing. I say this because paying for the game on steam will not get you any sort of customer support - although pirating it will !

I recommend you do not buy 170$ worth of DLC characters because that is a similarly scummy business practice you shouldn't encourage and rather just pirate this game, so you can play it freely with your buddies. What's more, you'll be reassured in knowing that pirating it means it will never stop working !",1580237903,1580237903,FALSE,0,0,0.434782594,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,14,1,143,0,143,1580233541

I don't understand how they could have made so many mistakes regarding pretty much everything, the DBZ games used to be so good on PS2 back in the day.
To sum up some of the problems I have with this game: 
- it takes minutes to launch
- it takes minutes to connect to online services
- servers are split into regions/countries
- team editing is such a nuisance, why can't we just pick characters/maps like in tekken
- a lot of characters are behind a paywall even when the base game is 60€
- you have to create a ring match to play with friends, you can't just create a lobby, pick a character and play
- online matchmaking takes a long while and when you finally get to play, the connection is usually very bad although you selected the best possible settings
- there are so many characters you can't even play, for example: no ginyu force (except for cpt ginyu), no transformations, no android 17, chaozu, goten, kid trunks, gero, dabura, goku/vegeta fusions, whis, videl,  supreme kai, any universe 6 character, roshi, jaco...
- even exiting the game takes too many steps, when in story mode you have to go trough more than 3 menus to quit
- no character creation
- only xbox controls, no playstation or other devices
- lack of story mode, you can complete it in less than half a day
- no co-op or tenkaichi tournament style PVP/PVE matches with friends

The graphics are beautiful, and honestly it looks better than the actual anime of Dragon Ball Super. The gameplay is pretty straightforward and the inputs for special moves aren't super complicated like older fighting games. That means you're not doing a bunch of half or full circle directional moves, it's all quarter circle, which is pretty simple. It let's you focus on your tactics rather than mastering frustrating gamepad combinations. The roster is pretty great, sure there are like 5 different Gokus, but it's DRAGON BALL. Each character feels pretty unique and i honestly wouldn't mind if they did a third season of DLC. I'd buy it.

The campaign leaves a little to be desired, mainly because you're fighting a bunch of clone/zombies of the main cast. But aside from that, it's done pretty well. Truly the best Dragon Ball game i've ever played.

The best animation in a fighting game ever made.

Team setup is highly important and if you're a veteran fighting game fan there are some really insane combos (ToD's) that require high skill and very precise input and mechanical execution so the skill ceiling is high. This does not mean the game isn't also casual friendly with a big story mode that has two difficulties and a very fun arcade mode.

This is the only fighting game i've played outside of smash and I suck honestly compared to anyone I fight online yet I really enjoy the offline experience and keep playing to get better scores on the arcade modes and story.

60710644,english,"I'm gonna be honest; I'm not really into most fighting games. Most just plunge you right into it, have complicated combos and complex techs that you HAVE to learn all by yourself if you wanna be considered in any way good. 

In this game, while the combos and techs do exist, there's a pretty smooth learning curve. Each individual attack is pretty unique, and if you don't want to waste hours learning complicated combos, there's a simple but rewarding auto-combo system (which doesn't take away from players who DO the complicated combos). It does it's job well, and actually makes me want to learn more to become better and better.

I haven't even mentioned the fact this is a Dragon Ball game yet. While I haven't watched the series in ages, this game's visuals, which look exactly like they were ripped straight from the anime, awoke the child inside of me. Every character and the way they interact feels spot-on.

However, I do think DLC is kinda overpriced... And I wouldn't say it's worth buying this game at full price. It's best if you can get it at some sale. And personally, I would avoid the Ultimate Edition--FighterZ edition gives you the same DLC Characters, and a Music and Commentator Pack just doesn't sound worth the extra money.",1577490967,1577490967,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,34,2,16634,271,436,1602028277

60658941,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is a very solid team combat fighting game. Let's find out why.

Pros:
[b]1. [/b]Easy to learn combo system, with an amazingly freeform combo game, in which any normal move (and most special moves) can be combo'd into pretty much anything, provided you can chain it together. Not to mention, autocombos allow bacically anyone to get at least something done if they don't mash buttons. Even more, Dynamic! autocombos allow for even the worst fighters to obtain Dragon Balls and deal loads of damage, if they can land them.
[b]2:[/b] A rushdown heavy game makes every match feel blazing fast, and with Dragon Ball inspired characters, moves, and movement, every moment feels right at home in the manga.
[b]3:[/b] The variety of characters is phenomenal. Every series has at least some representation (besides the original Dragon Ball, but the majority of prominent DB characters recurred in at least DBZ).
[b]4:[/b] I already touched on this in passing, but the movement is phenomenal, everything from footsies to your air game feels like it has real weight to it, and with instant transmission and chasing available for every character, you can create a lot of confusion with just movement alone; that means that not only are you going to be conscious of and practice your movement, but you'll also gain advantages by conditioning your opponent with your movement options as well as your actual fighting.
[b]5:[/b] The game has a really low entry barrier and a ridiculously high skill ceiling, and a low entry barrier isn't something you get in most Arcsys games.

Cons
[b]1:[/b] DLC is expensive as hell (I mean, it [i]is[/i] an Arcsys game, but that doesn't make it better).
[b]2:[/b] The personalization options can feel a bit lacking at times, which doesn't usually matter in fighting games, but with the amount of unique outfits and accessories the cast of Dragon Ball have worn, it's hard not to feel stiffed with a lot of stuff, I mean, they have colours similar to Vageta's Badman outfit, or Kid Gohan's battle armour, but no actual appearances of the outfits, aside from lobby avatars, if the outfits get any.
[b]3:[/b] The story, while alright, just drags on for way too long, considering that at the end of the day, it's just a grind fest combined with a visual novel.
[b]4:[/b] GT Goku. The fact that I also main him doesn't make it better.

Overall, like I said, it's a great game 9.5-10/10",1577439929,1577440305,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,79,22,3428,0,1285,1591436232

60502353,english,"I dont usualy write reviews, but ive invested a lot of time into this game that isnt actually playing the game. Usually I avoid competetive games because people get real fucking sweaty when it comes to them but I figured people treated this game as more of a casual game instead. So onto my point, the game is not friendly to new comers. Wanna play casual to try and practice and get your bearings? most people playing casual will beat your fucking face in and you actually cant move. now you can argue this happens to all new players in fighting games, well im not neccassarily that new, I've played many fighting games as well as I've watched countless hours of guieds, pro players, tutorials, and gameplay of this game because I love dragon ball and i like fighting games. Ok so you cant play casual cuz people who are just bullies and want an easy match will push your fucking face in, thats fine, well what about ranked? that way you can face people who are evenly matched. NOPE, the word ""evenly"" is used losely here, and i mean VERY losely. My first game of ranked was vs someone with 50000 bp. how is that even fucking possible? (you get 500 bp for a loss and i think 1000 for a win) he is NO WHERE NEAR my skill level, he has played an outstanding amount more than me. okay maybe that was a bug and it wont happen again sense I lost i can only go against worse right? NOPE, an even HIGHER ranked playter fought me next. Ok Ok fine fine but why dont you just look at the move list and learn combos and etc so you can have at least some chance of not being combo'd into the cieling, NOPE the move list only tells you the most basic of basics, it tells you no special moves it doesnt define its words (like wtf rush means or what it does) OK OK youre just complaining because youre bad get good and go play the campaign and tutorial. my argument to that is, so in order to not be bullied online by sweaty players in casual and to not go against unfairly matched players in ranked i have to play against computers for god knows how long to learn how to play against... YOU GUESSED IT COMPUTERS. the computers dont play ANYTHING like the players. with players you have to predict and outplay and block etc etc. computer? you can just mash the same button and they die they wont ever block. and they just randomly drop combos....OK OK go do all of the training. tried that.... IT BUGGED OUT ON THE FIRST FUCKING TRAINING AND STOPPED WORKING. this is a 60 dollar game,,,,, with an INSANE amount of dlc characters (which everyone uses btw and they are significantly better than the characters that come with the game but i try not to play this side of the coin cuz crying p2w is a trigger mechanism for many of the people on the spectrum for this type of game) so why in the world would it EVER bug, letalone on the VERY FIRST TRAINING MISSION. inexcusable. and look maybe youre really good at fighting games. or maybe you dont care about pvp you only care about story, or maybe you boguht it on sale, well good im glad that the franchise can live on through people like you so they can create, hopefully, a better pvp fighting game (god dont get me started on pvp in xenoverse)",1577253985,1577253985,FALSE,1,2,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,211,11,50,0,50,1577253275

In lieu of it being a team fighting game, the characters have more simplified moves-mostly just quarter circles back and forward- compared to to other more mainstream fighters like KOF or Street Fighter.
 It is also a very intuitive fighting game. There are a lot of systems that are very beginner friendly that can help a-lot such as autocombo's. The combo's themselves are also very easy to do with very forgiving timing, none of them require accurate one frame links to execute. There is a natural combo progression, from light to medium to heavy attacks, that most characters have to follow and can make learning cool looking combo's a breeze.
 However, there is also a more complicated side to find if you so wish. Plus the game is great looking. If you like games like Marvel vs Capcom 2 then you'll love this.

It was also extremely easy to get into, I felt like I was able to start improving as soon as I started playing, while with other fighters I've kind of just felt stuck upon trying to get into it. Only downside I see is how annoying it is getting demolished by smurfs who do super long lasting dlc character combos that get super repetitive. Some matches just feel like I'm watching a 3 minute video of me getting my ass beat, but obviously as I get better at the game I'll be able to deal with them better, so I don't see it as a huge problem.

59466880,english,"Pros:
Visuals: Good graphics, it looks pretty close to the anime, they greatly fixed their cell shade technique so it doesnt look awful anymore,
Combat: The fighting is fluid and is more of a regular fighter in controls, though i do miss the budokai combat system.

Cons
Single player: The Story is weeeeeeak, they have made some abominable concoction of a story just to make the player fit into a role in the dbz world (and having characters interact with the player) they could of just retold the same old story and it would of been fine imo. also the main enemies you fight are just clones of the z fighters.
Financial Capital: Good ol Zeni, i find almost no reason to want zeni or capsules for that matter, after buying a thousand of the bastards they dont seem to unlock anything worth a fuck, sure as hell not characters (good ol' american dollars are reservered for that), buying capsules just gives you different colors of the same outfit and sound/songs and i think artwork so nothing important.
CHARACTERS BEHIND PAYWAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSS! Do you like playing as yamcha? or tien? how about fat ol majin buu, or just generic goku, you'd better like playing them cause are free! if you want the fun character get ready to throw some shekels, thankfully 1 of the 2 vegetas is free otherwise i would write a bad review.

---Cons---
Would be better if it had less gtgoku and bardock cheese as they severely dumb down the game, turning whiffs into actual convertable combos. While other characters suffer due to having less forgiving combos.

the netcode is pretty horrid at times, Even with a green connection you will get roughly 5 frame delay which can still put people off to dropping some combos.

The blockstrings in this game can be incredibly long and I had a hard time figuring out when It was essentially my turn in this game, as you progress to tougher players it becomes a lot more stressful for defending.

--Pros--
-It's a beautiful looking game.

-The combos are super fun to do and easy to learn until you want to try your hand at tougher characters like Ginyu.

-Being able to build your own team gives you the option to make your own kind of combos for some creative fun and more reasons to try out other characters.

-Its still got a thriving community even after months of the games release.

-a fairly good match making system so even the most novice of players will always find someone of roughly equal skill, with the option to fight tougher players.

Laptop (Asus EEE Slate ep121, Intel Dual-Core i5 470um): 
Even with the lowest possible settings this game looks and plays horrible. Which is really a shame cause I always like to take my laptop everywhere, especially since I'm a college student. Was looking forward to play with friends but yeah, this is just not going to happen

Desktop, (some Asus PC I built, AMD A4-5300, Radeon HD Graphics):
Like again, Lowest setting just to make sure things would run smoothly... 
Game was amazing, and ran at a good framerate. Honestly was suprised, cause it was a pain to download and install compaired to my laptop. 
The biggest con here though is that I intended to get this game to play with friends, and I don't see myself carrying my desktop tower with me everywhere I go. Or leaving it on at home for streaming...

Controller (Hori Switch B attle Pad:
If you plan on using this controller on PC with this game, I strongly recommend changing the controlls a bit cause it still treats it like an Xbox controller with the lettering being the same.
Pressing B+Y to teleport will not be comfortable so I reccomend mapping that to LS instead. 
I don't know how Switch treats the controls and I'm worried about that...

On a personal note to the game developers
- They should've released an actual demo to allow PC users to test if the game can run on their systems instead of having to buy, play under 2 hrs, then request refund if it doesn't work... Reading spects alone doesn't help cause as a Novice PC user, I cannot tell if my Graphics card is good or not, cause manufactures do not list the cards by any order but weird ass names.
Because of this stupid new trend of Beta testing, I missed the chance to actually try the game on PC!

PROS- 
    - Great attention to detail by the Devs
    - While being easy to pick up and mash square it also has a solid level of depth to allow for growth into competitive play
    - A great diverse cast full of characters that are all decent enough to hold their own
    - Tons of callbacks to Dragonball Z, with lots of easter eggs and attacks based off of moves in the show.
    - Does a great job not looking like Dragonball, but looking like you remember Dragonball
CONS-
    - The net code is kind of lacking, compared to other Anime game net code though (Ninja Storm 4, Sao GGO) it is quite good

From a visual standpoint alone this game takes the cake, using moves from the anime or manga right down to the last detail. The gameplay is simple to learn, but difficult to master, and you'll have a ton of fun coming up with combos while you wait for a match.

The story is ok. I like that it has a new character, and as a fan I can appreciate the dialogue. However, it can sometimes feel like fan service. 'What would these two characters say to each other if they were together'. At times it can get cringe worthy too. It wouldn't feel out of place at 9am on Saturday with the early morning cartoons.

I still play this game regularly after almost two years. With any other Dragon Ball game, once I've completed it, it goes on the shelf, never to be played again. Not with this game. I want to hop right back in and watch Goku activate his Kaioken, or Gogeta to do his level 5 super. I want to land the combos that I practice online. I love this game.

This is a really impressive game
After putting nearly 100 hours into the game, mostly playing 1v1 with my friend, I can say
This game does a fantastic job of carrying forward the awesome legacy of the vanish fights from Budokai 3, it's even faster now, more like Dbz, easier to control and the dragon rush's work much better and are not annoying. A lot of dynamic stuff can happen surprisingly. 

Nice job on Broly guys, his attacks being like from the first movie; and pretty much all characters and their attacks in this game are just on point like that 
Artwork and animations in this game are just awesome
For best epic results mute music and play with Faulconer Productions score : ) 

Guys just please add...Mecha Frieza and Mecha Cooler....C'mon...it would not even be that hard ...like you don't have to change their attacks at all or add a new character, just add this as an appearance for them, please...so we can cut up Mecha Frieza with Trunks, etc.. this is a No Brainer ... 
And please add Majin Vegeta lol ... really Fat Buu and no Majin Vegeta to counter him? C'mon this is so close to being perfect : ) 

Also wouldn't mind a Super Buu...like maybe Gohan or Gotenks absorbed Buu : ) or just base Super Buu
Mystic Gohan could have that sick meteo finish against him in particular when you use his ultimate against him

Really a fantastic DBZ fighting game
This was the next level, ""even further beyond!"", the game we needed after Budokai series... doing it justice...with the dragon rush system here being much better suited for multiplayer than Budokai 3's (known to be its one snag). If you were into Budokai, well I was too, and IMO this is really good 

Fights really feel and look like the show! Still seeing new things after over 30 hrs of play. Very fun with friends and your own tunes (Faulconer score! Epic! We use watch2gether while we play so our dbz music playlist is synced up). 
Everything is gorgeous and the stages are awesome, although one or two more maybe would be cool -- A desert stage with Buu's house &/or Babidi's lair entrance in the background would be cool!

Game is literally unplayable. Lag spikes galore, garbage connections, and I'm 98% sure there are bots mixed into ranked and casual games just to give the appearance of a larger player base. Game is dead.

The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics and the Solo/Local gameplay. I have a great time playing with someone else in the same room as me, and the story mode (although a bit underwhelming) was fun an light hearted. Also all of the customization options are fun as well.

The bullshit begins when you start playing online matches. 
-matches aren't actually based on similar rank, despite what it says
-you can wait up to 20 min for just one casual match
-good luck getting an arena match going. just don't
-combos are auto
-no penalty for rage quiters in ranked match, and no points awarded to the winner of that match

+Initially try to combo but then just end up button mashing like a dolt, but then you win and feel bad that your terrible techniques somehow won you the match
+Play terrible in the anime characters like Yamcha and cackle like a madman when they underestimate your ability to wolf fang on em' (Yamcha is lit)

The graphics are simply amazing, and the fights are so intense with crazy visual effects! Out of anime fighters, this has got to be one of the greats. I basically only have one problem with the game, which is that the CPUs are essentially punching bags. The AI is not very smart, and playing against them is so much of a cakewalk you cannot improve by fighting against them. This might not be an issue to some, but I personally like to improve in a fighting game by trying my hand against the toughest CPUs before I go head to head with a real player, but this game does not offer that option because of how underdeveloped the AI is. Outside of this niche complaint, the game plays wonderfully and I would highly recommend it to any veteran or newcomer to the anime fighting game genre.

57336832,english,"So, nobody else is going to say it? Okay, well, someone has to.

This game is terrible.

I came into high hopes for this. Arc System Works are the masters of the fighting game genre. Where most franchises excel at either technical play (Street Fighter Alpha, the Namco games) and some at spectacle (Netherrealm games), BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena are games that are the peak of pefection in both aspects of fighting games. While some (BBCP) are better than others (GG Isuka), they consistently produce top-shelf fighters.

Well, except Isuka. And Dragonball FighterZ. In fact, Dragonball FighterZ is not only the worst game ASW have ever made, it's one of the worst fighters in DECADES.

Presentation is what everyone praises about this but... I'm sorry, but no. The presentation here is absolutely nothing special. The menu is BBCP's with a DragonBall coat of paint on it. The roster is utterly anemic, with half the roster locked behind DLC and even with DLC there's some unforgivable gaps. Where's Mr. Satan? Why are the Ginyus just ancillary to the Captain? Why is Gotenks and Worst Goku the only kid characters? DB Xenoverse got it right. DBFZ's presentation just feels lazy. The spectacle feels just very bland and the Dramatic finishes are lacking, the few we do get have arcane requirements to pull off and they could have done so much more than 'this is how the fight ended in the anime'. If you're going to do that, show more! How could Krillin defeat Cell, for example. How would Freeza have beaten Goku? So much potential in that idea... but they went the lazy route.

Story mode is another dissapointment. The VAs do a stellar job, and seem the only people involved with this game that gave half a crap. The story itself however is razor thin compared to ASW fare. What is there is decent... but it could have been better. It's a McDonald's burger. It'll do in a pinch, but not as good as a real burger.

Gameplay is utterly boring. Controls are responsive and nothing is broken, but there's no depth whatsoever. Everyone plays virtually exactly the same. It doesn't even feel like an Arc System Works fighter despite using a dumbed-down version of the engine. Feels more like an alpha for a Capcom crossover fighter than anything.

Overall a shoddy licensed cashgrab. DB Xenoverse felt true to the series and was clearly made with passion. DB FighterZ does not and was not.

Shame on Arc System Works. You guys are so much better than this! BlazBlue but DBZ sounds great on paper but the execution just isn't there.

Avoid at all costs. Even if you're a huge DBZ fan. Just watch an LP of the story instead. It'll be actually more fun than actually playing this abomination of a game. Get DB Xenoverse instead. If you're a fighting game fan, play any other Arc System Works game. If you never played one before, I'd suggest the entire BlazBlue franchise because the story in those games are utterly epic and you kind of need to start from the beginning to make sense of it. 

Scores:

Presentation: 5/10, and that's mostly because of the VA work. Marks taken off for missed potential.

Gameplay: 2/10. It's not broken, and it's responsive. But it's still miserably dull. 

Story: 2/10. Story Mode campaign is grindy and the plot makes less sense the more it's explained. Points deducted for a complete lack of arcade endings, as that basically makes arcade mode a waste of time for people looking for lore or story in them.

Overall: 1/10. Marks taken off again for missed potential and failure to live up to the Arc System Works legacy. I am being harsh here, but ASW let me down.",1573966926,1573966926,FALSE,0,0,0.476190478,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,333,67,1637,0,1637,1573966610

It definitely took a lot of time for me to be able to somewhat confidently play against another player online. Especially with a game that's been out for a while, lots of very good players.

I don't really care for the single player - since more difficult CPUs cheat by just doing more damage. (At least in Arcade mode) Not sure if the story mode uses this method as well.

The ranking system pits you up against players nearly perfectly. You'll almost always be playing against someone on the same level as you. If you want to play against someone better or worse than you, you can ask the game to pair you up that way. It's fun. You get compared to different dragonball character types and levels based on your skill/rank. The more points the better the comparison. You start off as a saibamen. It feels special when you hit supersaiyan for the first time.
Boss mode is perfect. 3 strangers versus tough bots. Very nice. Krillin needs to be nerfed for Boss mode but buffed for online ranked play.
 The character roster is very balanced aside from Broly, Gogeta, Gt Goku and Ultimate Gohan.
The Z union system lets you know the popularity of dragonball characters but is skewed on in game viability. Android 16 used to be the most popular dragonball character for example.
Training mode is perfect for learning combos.

Bad:
If the opponent rage quits, they're rewarded.
Super armor moves in this game are broken.
Ultimate Gohan has an infinte attacking loop.
The developers noticed the game was losing popularity and threw game balancing out the window. Every new DLC character is the best character in the game. Other than Broly, Gogeta, Gt Goku and Gohan, the game is perfectly balanced.

[*] Easy to pick up. Great game for people getting into fighting games.

[*] Wonderful character and stage themes.

[*] Absolutely stunning anime-style graphics you won't find outside of an Arc Sys game.

[*] Very friendly community, one of the more positive FGC communties

[*] Active servers, especially for a PC Fighting Game, expect less matches at the higher ranks/during off-peak hours.

Cons:
[*] Bad delay-based netcode. 

[*] Random lag spikes occur that only seem to disappear when restarting the game, makes it borderline unbearable

[*] Weak tutorial and single player content. I'm sad to see Arc Sys abandon the fantastic tutorial they had in Guilty Gear Xrd. 

[*] Lack of playstyle variety.

However, what all the people had in common was respect and genuine love for this game. Sure i might get upset sometimes but every match i lost makes me feel that it wasn’t the games fault but rather my fault for not being able to match up with my opponent‘a skill level. The only other game that made me understand this challenging ness was DOTA2, but even in dota 2, dbfz has a community that is super great. Every match has always ended with both of us thanking each other for the match all the while being respectful to each other and in my opinion, this is the most important part. Onto the skill cap, this game continues to prove it immensly high level cap with great adaptability and great characters that synergise well with the game while still being incredibly enjoyable.

The issues are that the gameplay is extremely repetitive, unlike the Xenoverse games which involve strategy when fighting and have a large variety of side-quests, this game is far too repetitive to the point of being a bit tedious. It's a button-masher that I struggle to play for longer than 15 mins at a time.

The main reason that I even play longer than 15 mins is because the load time between fights is so long, seriously the load times are longer than the fights, it reminds me of the old PS1 generation of video games. All that beautiful animation comes at a price.

56679118,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is genuinely a great game. It has it's bad habits that many games do nowadays (micro-transactions and broken patches), but as far as speaking on terms of fighting games and Dragon Ball games, it's pretty solid. 
Dragon Ball games have had a really bad habit over the past couple of decades that cause them to be only mediocre or repetitively bad. They usually all tell the exact same story (ie: the entire DBZ saga) and they usually all have the same hashed out Bandai Namco gameplay. However, FighterZ uniquely breaks that chain, by giving you a traditional fighting style game and keeps the spirit of the anime. It has very tight and comfortable button controls and combos that make for a great experience. I will say, this game is difficult when it comes to fighting games. Like most, you have to master the game in certain ways. Be patient with each session and learn your combos. Once you pick up a character you like and sit down to learn how they play, it becomes massively easier to play with other players. 

I'd like to say that this game deserves a chance by people and should be considered high on your list if you are a fan of fighting games and/or Dragon Ball!",1573115258,1573115258,TRUE,21,0,0.642031491,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,66,3,1074,0,423,1596518849

Pros:
-Excellent visuals and animations
-Deep gameplay that is very easy to learn the basics of in spite of the high skill ceiling
-Good net code for the most part, albeit input delay can be frustrating at the worst of times
-Careful attention to detail, with clever references in the dramatic finishes and destructible backgrounds giving battles an action heavy feel to them
-Lots of unique dialogue between characters
-Great voice acting on both the English and Japanese side
-Enjoyable fanservice, at least considering the little I know about the series
-Decent roster of characters
-Mod support for most aesthetic mods

Cons:
-Terrible and confusing lobby system and over complicated method of playing with friends
-Story mode is repetitive and boring. It is a step up from the movie length cutscenes of guilty gear's story but it isn't particularly satisfying either.
-Arcade sticks require tampering with files to work, and playing with friends from another country require you to change steam's download region
-Expensive by fighting game standards
-A few questionable balance decisions, mostly relating to Bardock
-No punishment for rage quitting, if anything it rewards you with a flawless winrate if you rage quit

As for the game system, I really haven't played much multiplyer to know the complexity of combat system. However, it seems to me that combat system is very easy to enter, but complicated enough for hardcore fighting game enthusiasts.

There is Fighterz edition $94.98 and Ultimate edition $109.97 plus. Again I love the game but look at this Mortal Kombat Komplete edition for how much it cost there and see how much it cost. $19.99 for everything characters, DLC, modes, and stages, not $100.00 or $60.00 and yes I know about the new mortal kombat X (10) and 11 where it cost around the same price as dragon ball fighterz with it's DLC and game pass. Look at the games back then and now. You may have seen that in the games of now are $59.99 but later on the games are now $29.99 like fallout 4, it was $59.99 now it's $29.99. So again I don't hate the game but I would like to unlock characters not pay for the characters cause that can be a big problem for people who haven't bought the characters not knowing of how this or that character fight plus know how to counter back.

If you still love this game it's fine. You still love dragon ball thats fine.

On the other hand there is likely to be some enjoyment if they just want to see more Dragon Ball franchise lore first hand. That being said if those same people only want to play multiplayer at home with friends the game mechanics are not so complex that it's totally unintuitive to naturally get better.

Dragon Ball FighterZ? What's that?

Review. Dragon Ball FighterZ. I love it. Probably nostalgia is a strong factor. Objectively, I can identify a small list of flaws you may want to consider before opening your wallet (it is a pricey title after all the DLC).

Controls strike me as being designed for console, not PC. Took me a while to re-assign everything to a comfortable layout. If you're tech savvy enough to plug your Playstation/X-box controller into you PC, probably not an issue. 

Story mode. VERY repetitive. Endless clone minions. Saps the fun from a decent saga story.

Online Multiplayer. What, you enjoy getting spanked or something?  Those guys have been perfecting combo chains since release. I'm just a casual gamer and a fighting genre noob. I steer clear of it. Still, online multiplayer looks to be 3/4 of the game. So 3/4 of what you're paying for.

Combat. Even a fighting genre noob can see the real trick is to keep your opponent trapped and stunned in a never-ending combo chain. Figure out how to get out of it when they do the same back to you. Not at all much more depth to the combat. All your favourite special attacks from the series play like cinematics. The team of three, tag team element is nice. Hyper Dimension sure couldn't do that.",1571984955,1571985831,TRUE,2,0,0.511937499,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,76,8,3931,0,2737,1587867193

55739146,english,"So... Dragon Ball FighterZ. This game is regarded as one of the best fighting games of recent years and I do feel that way as well. This game is really good and enjoyable. But there are some things that in my opinion, have decreased the game's value and could have been executed better. I have tried to make my points more brief than other reviews I have written because of time constraints. But if you still need a TL;DR summary, just skip to the end.

Let's get all the positives out of the way first. This game looks and sounds AMAZING. Not only the graphical style is utterly gorgeous, but the English dub (I'm not really a fan of JP dub in this franchise) and the music tracks of the game are seriously good.

Even the gameplay is really fun; despite being simplified in comparison to other ArcSys fighters (excluding BBTAG. I prefer not to talk about that game). Although I have to say that it feels kinda limited and does not have the same amount of freedom that games like Guilty Gear or BlazBlue offer in their gameplay. So, there's a chance that the game might become repetitive.

Now... let's rant about the things I have serious problems with:

[h1] Story Mode [/h1]
This game uses a cinematic story mode which is kinda similar to the same thing in Guilty Gear Xrd. The story revolves around this mysterious character named Android 21 (a new character in the DB universe created by Akira Toriyama himself) and what she does. But overall... it's both a great thing and a great disaster at the same time. Because it has a lot of nice moments and also a lot of issues.

The story is presented in a pretty weird way in my opinion. The story mode features 3 story arcs; each one of them focusing on a different set of characters and how they go through the story events. Now this would have been great if these arcs DIDN'T RETCON EACH OTHER! Contrary to what you might have thought, every story arc has it's own story-line & ending, and aside from some minor points and events, does not show the same story from different perspectives. So in the first two arcs, you're basically going through ""What If?"" scenarios with little real events and the last arc is where the exact real events take place. I don't know about you, but that seems like a waste of time to me; even if the special events that happen by using certain characters in your team (like using Nappa & Yamcha) are pretty great.

To be honest, the decision to let people play through the story instead of watching it (like Guilty Gear Xrd's story mode) is great and was much needed. But it has not executed well and I would be lying if I say the game doesn't get repetitive & boring after a while. All you do in the story mode is fighting clones over, and over, and over again. And the AI difficulty is pretty inconsistent as well, constantly changing between a scale of ""dumb as a rock"" and ""you're already dead""; meaning sometimes it doesn't do anything noticeable and sometimes it pummels you like you're playing a match against Daigo or SonicFox. Even the light RPG elements (like leveling up and using special skills which make the story mode really similar to M.O.M. mode in Guilty Gear Xrd) can't do anything to fix this repetitiveness and sometimes, make it even worse.

[h1] Arcade Mode [/h1]
To be quite honest, I don't like the new take on arcade mode in this game. In this game's arcade mode, you are presented with a map that has several paths with different opponents, and which path you take is based on how good you play the matches. This means if you play the game really good, then the difficulty gets higher and vice versa, and you can even get different opponents based on your performance. Now this is a nice idea, but what if I just want a normal arcade mode where I can customize my own experience? Maybe I just want to blow off some steam and pummel some easy/normal AI opponents. With this system, you cannot do that.

Other than that, there's almost no reason to replay the arcade mode rather than trying to increase your score. In other fighting games, you can beat an arcade ladder with a character and get an illustration or a video as a reward each time you do so. But here? None of that is present.

[h1] Online Modes [/h1]
I don't play online that much (being a busy guy doing... business) and have no idea about how the netcode is (people say it's average at its best and abysmal at its worst). But if you want my advice about online modes, if you don't want to get absolutely destroyed, don't try ranked matches without proper training. This game has been out for a year and nearly everyone in the online mode is a beast who traps you in seemingly endless combos, which ruins the fun completely. I really advise you to play with a friend or join a community and find people who are willing to play with you for now. After a while and gathering more experience, start taking on the other guys in the ranked mode.

[h1] The Roster [/h1]
I know... this has been said a lot before. But seriously, why there are 3 Gokus, 3 Vegetas and 2 Brolys in the roster? I know each one of them is from a different series or story arc, but that's honestly a lot. They could have added much more requested characters. Like... for example... a guy named Mr. Satan?

[h1] Lack of Modes [/h1]
Let me explain this. The story is repetitive and the arcade mode is seriously a downgrade compared to other fighters, as there's almost no reason to replay it.This game could have had much more modes to offer to the players; modes that already exist in many other fighting games and could have added a lot of value to the game for those who play offline like me or even those who play online. For example, a party mode like KOF XIV where you can play with up to 6 players (some say this exists in the switch version and not PC & console versions for some odd reason), a challenge mode where you have to defeat the enemy under special circumstances (like the tutorial fight in early parts of story mode or the same mode in GGXXAC+R), or even a classic survival mode. Hell, you can even use the same excuse in the story mode and create an online mode like Heroes & Heralds in UMVC3!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1] [b] TL;DR [/b] [/h1]
Dragon Ball FighterZ is not flawless; it has many issues and some tidbits & design choices that could have been executed better. But it is also really fun to play. If you want to play offline, then play it in short bursts to avoid repetitiveness; although I don't recommend the game due to how lackluster it is in this regard. And if you want to play online without fear of losing over and over again, find someone friendly to play against.",1571885435,1571955700,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,728,40,1073,0,861,1582662408

- Low playerbase on PC
- DLC Characters that definitely should be unlockables
- Can be very aggravating like all fighting games 
- AI is not fun to fight against because they are too easy or too hard

If it does, repeat the process until it no longer crashes. Also leads to the game randomly closing, then the crashing starts after relaunching.

Second, verify game files. This generally doesn't work.

[b](B)[/b] If you take the game seriously enough to compete online.

Although it is easy for beginners to get into this game due to auto-combos (which some people will say is a selling-point for casuals), once you peel back the onion it is very difficult & frustrating to compete against someone who knows what they are doing.  You need to dedicate a lot of time in order to fully appreciate the cast of characters and how they play in battle (outside of tapping Light Attack ad nauseam).

I know this is basically true in virtually any fighting game, but in DBFZ it is especially true.  DBFZ is one of the most unforgiving 2D fighting games I've ever played (for better or for worse, depending on the skill disparity). 

Part of the reason is because the meta-game is very fast and quick-thinking compared to other 2D fighting games.  So, unless you and your friend(s) are relatively matched in skill/knowledge, you probably won't play for very long before someone quits out of frustration, helplessness, or boredom.

Once you give up on trying to convince your friends to play, you are then stuck trying to compete online.  And, well, online is neither for the feint of heart nor for those who don't have the time/patience to learn.

[h1]The Good![/h1]
[list]
[*]Ark System Works (ASW) usually knocks it out of the park when it comes to the visual style, graphical fidelity, and sound design in their games. DBFZ is no exception, as it is one of the best looking fighting games ever. DBFZ also includes a great musical score using old and new compositions.
[*]Stellar fighting mechanics that allow for near-marvel levels of insane setups and combos that not only look great but do tons of damage, but also accommodates for lower skill levels and offers plenty of ways to enter a situation.
[*]Has absolutely fantastic training modes that let you set up just about anything and test for whatever you want to find out.
[*]Offers a handful of online and offline modes and also has a competitive ranked mode.
[*]The game is still in its prime with a lot of hype, being actively supported and holding regular tournaments, and the community for this game isn't going to dwindle for another good few years.
[*]If you're into the current Dragon Ball franchise at all, you will get to enjoy plenty of fanservice with some of the franchise's most popular characters.
[*]Character balancing is slowly improving. However while the top tiers have cycled through this game's lifespan you will still find yourself fighting people online who collectively pick the same 6-7 characters.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad![/h1]
[list]
[*]The roster is incredibly small for a Dragon Ball game, even compared to games like Xenoverse 1, and about half of the DBFZ roster is DLC. That's Scamco for you!
[*]Did I mention the DLC is ludicrously expensive when it's not on sale? Allegedly, even those who purchased the Ultimate Edition (FULL PRICE BEING $109.97, MIND YOU) don't get all of the DLC. Scamco has done this kind of crap for other titles, most relevantly to Dragon Ball being Xenoverse 2. They will release multiple different ""sets"" of character/DLC packs so that even if you buy a set of packs, you will have to buy the new set! It is no different in DBFZ, currently nearing the end of its second $25 season pass. Expect a third season pass to be announced sooner than you think. But hey, at least DBFZ 2 isn't coming anytime soon!
[*]The lobby system is garbage, and almost unnecessary on top of that. At least it doesn't detract from the game all too much, but you still have to enter it even when you play offline.
[*]You may be wondering if I was ever going to mention a story mode, or you might not even care that it has a story mode. Some fighting game story modes tend to be superfluous after all, and it most certainly is in DBFZ. The fanservice is there at times, but it is mostly in the character interactions that you have between team members. The actual story is forgettable and not worth going into, only a portion of it dedicated as an introduction to Android 21 who is written in a lackluster manner. The gameplay consists of doing fight after fight with clone versions of the main cast, and it gets repetitive very fast. The maps in which these fights are laid out are almost pointless and only serve as a micro-commute between other teams on said maps to challenge. It's only worth to go through so you can create a Zeni farm by the time you're done, as well as to unlock Android 21, Goku Blue and Vegeta Blue.

55224032,english,"My Review of Dragon Ball Fighter Z

Story (took 8 hours to complete);
I can’t say good things about story mode other than well voice acted. I didn’t enjoy the story and found it very tedious and a waste of time because of an awkward leveling system (that creates artificial difficulty that just makes enemies deal/receive more/less damage), a slow paced story, and a limited roster of playable characters in this mode. The only value in story mode is unlocking android 21, but to unlock her you need to play story mode 3 times. I would recommend buying the fighter pass (More info in future value and DLC) because the time you spend playing the story mode could be better spent in training mode, learning the characters play-styles and their techniques, playing local/online battles, or even arcade mode for a pretty good challenge (you can get better at the game faster via stronger opponents and challenge versus computers who practically let you win in story mode).

Other Modes:

Local Mode:
The settings are basic but they work. Select your player limit (1-3), select your difficulty and go. The best part of local is the CPU difficulty slider that tailors to your skill level (though there is a point even after max difficulty where I go to online mode to get an extra challenge).

Arcade mode: 
It’s a simple number of rounds from (3-5-7) on easy or hard. It provides a nice challenge and the way this game does its arcade mode is something I find interesting. It increases in challenge depending on your gameplay performance, S-A, Challenge goes up, B, challenge is constant, and C-D, Challenge is lowered. 

Training Mode:
I find myself coming back to this mode frequent because the combo challenges give a quick tutorial of each character but can be limited in that it shows a limited amount of technique combinations and doesn’t show many advance techniques. 


Gameplay;
Game play is easy to pick up.

Offense
The basic combo loop is; Weak, Mid, Strong, Projectile, Technique, Super
And you can skip ahead if you need a different type of move.
Techniques are executed by quarter inputs and the technique and speed is based on whether it was a weak, mid, or strong attack. 
This game contains a super meter. Using quarter inputs and the triggers each character has at least 2 supers. A super uses 1 bar and an ultra that uses 3.
The player has access to a vanish (cost 1 meter) that teleports the player behind the opponent and strikes them so they bounce them off the wall.
The player has access to two other playable characters via the left triggers and if you have a meter after a super by pressing the corresponding trigger you can swap into your other character that follows with their special on entering. 

Defense
Blocking is hold back to block overhead and standing attacks, vulnerable to crouching attacks and back and down (diagonally away) to block crouching and standing attacks, vulnerable to overhead and jumping attacks. 
Blocking can be broken by grabs
Grabs in this game can be used on the ground and air and can be used to force swap the opponents team mates or extend combos. (Opponents can’t be grabbed during an attack).

Movement 
Basic left and right movement with dashing and back stepping.
A homing dash called a dragon dash can be used to fly towards your opponent but can also be used to extend combos such as after a heavy attack. ! Watch out, for dragon dashing can be countered by a crouching heavy attack 


Future Value and DLC; 
Local battle is great for a quick match and unwinding after a stressful day. 
Online provides strong people to improve your gameplay skill. 
The combo challenge in training mode makes it easy to get reacquainted with characters you haven’t used in some time.
The game is simple enough to teach a friend for a quick match but complex enough to have depth.

DLC;
I find the DLC is overpriced on default and would wait for a sale (This game goes on sale constantly). 
The first DLC is 35$ for 8 characters and unlocking android 21 without playing story mode (defiantly worth it to avoid the story mode). I bought this first DLC at 17.50 and that was worth it for me. 
There is more DLC on the way for the second set but I’m waiting till all the content is released before purchasing.
I do have a strong feeling that a 3rd DLC will be created but I may be wrong on that. 

Other Nitpicks;
SSGSS Vegeta and Goku are locked until you buy them of unlock them via gaining 300,000 and 500,000 zenny, if you enjoy the game or do story mode (which I advise against) you’ll unlock them without paying, but if you don’t enjoy the game as much as the game expects you to, then this is going to be a problem for your experience of the game. 


My Recommendation;
I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting games, with friends or online people.
I spent the most amount of time in local battle for 20 minutes of unwinding or break time, I’ll often go to training modes combo challenge to have an idea on how the character is “supposed” to be played, and go online for a nice challenge against a real person.

Pros:

-Each character feels unique.

Cons:
-Only one character is unlockable rest are must pay DLC.
-The lobby system is... unique...
-The campaign (which you must play to get android 21) will make you want to bash your head against the wall again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again ect. ect. 

Overall If you are looking for a decent clean fighting game to play, I would recommend picking this game up.

54940375,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ has a power level that transcends time and space by combining the iconic DBZ franchise with true fighting game mechanics.

This combination has resulted in a catastrophic cluster crunch that any fighting game or DBZ fan should take a long look at.

Here are some features to consider:

- A sizable roster of 30+ with DLC. Noteworthy fighters include Yamcha, Piccolo the Namekian, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Vegito, the entire Ginyu Force as one character, and 5 different versions of Goku. All characters possess unique movesets unlike popular DBZ games such as Budokai Tenkaichi 3, where the roster is insanely huge, but the characters have little differences between each other.

- DBFZ uses 3-on-3 tag team style combat similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom, which means you have characters popping in to chuck destructo discs and senzu beans all over the place, swapping characters mid-fight, and you can have all 3 of your characters jump in at once to BLAST your opponent with an array of giant ultimate attacks.

- As a traditional fighting game, there is plenty of depth, strategy, and techniques to learn that will keep the dedicated players busy.

- Because the game is 3v3, and there are 3 different versions of Vegeta in the game, you have the choice to play as only Vegeta. This is a big selling point.

- I believe that the visuals in DBFZ are the most impressive to ever grace a fighting game, and is stunning to look at compared to any video game. Characters' attacks are extremely faithful to the source material, and the hand-drawn/3D model style that allows for dynamic camera angles and perspective is a great accomplishment on its own.

- And of course, there any many iconic, heavy-hitting, bunker-busting, ultra-mega special moves that each character can use that will result in both hype and world destruction. Gohan brings in the whole fam to launch a triple Kamehameha beam, Majin Buu can get angry and blow up the entire screen, Android 16 can try to grab you and self-destruct, INSTANTLY KILLING YOU. The list goes on and on.

The bottom line here, is that it's Dragon Ball Z combined with proper fighting game mechanics. It is a combo so deadly, that many pairs of pants were soiled at the moment of its first debut.

DBFZ is easily one of my favorite fighting games out there. It is an easy recommendation for fighting game fans, and especially for those who enjoy watching Chiaotzu blow himself up to do massive damage to the enemy.",1567460089,1567460089,TRUE,5,2,0.57718122,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,121,25,23831,0,20742,1600315909

I watched the Dragon Ball cartoon growing up and remember playing a DBZ fighter when I was younger.  I don't watch cartoons now.  I still find the game pretty fun and a good break from more serious fighters.   The game looks mediocre but good.  The music is incredibly repetitive and annoying.  Every time it cycles it makes me just a little more angry.  In contrast to Tekken that I can leave on in the background constantly.  The menu is stupid.

41149587,english,"Love the game, couple of caveats,


First, the DLC is pretty steep. It's already a 60$ game, and the roster is already pretty small for them to be charging an additional 35$ for 8 extra characters. Also considering how many clone characters are on the cast, you'd think they would be less greedy. I didn't mind paying 5 bucks for Bardock, but there really should be more free characters.

Second, the three unlockable characters in the game are a real pain in the butt to get. For Android 21, you have to complete the story mode. Which doesn't sound bad, until you play it. It's mind-numbingly boring. It's rediculously easy, and it mainly consists of watching the same rehashed cutscenes over and over and fighting wimpy NPCs to clear maps. I'd pay 5 more dollars to unlock 21 instead of wasting several hours of my time, but weirdly she is the only character you can't pay to unlock. 

Also there are still force-closing errors over a month after release. Hopefully this will get hotfixed soon. (edit 2019, it did)


I do highly recommend this game. It's one of the funnest fighting games I've played in a very long time. If you like DBZ and you like 2D fighting games, you will absolutely love this game. Hopefully with support from the developers (which is great, so far), we will see some of these issues addressed in the coming months. And hopefully the remaining 6 DLC characters will be something other than more Goku variants. We have 3 generations of Gokus, plus all his kids, plus 2 Vegetas, all of whom play somewhat similarly. Come on Bandai. You have a literal multiverse and hundreds of episodes-worth of fucking amazing characters to choose from. Add someone interesting for the love of Jesus.

54206317,english,"For such a simple and adrenaline pumped world, THIS GAME is the BEST format for DBZ to me. Thank you BANDAI NAMCO! We all know how cool this game is. What concerns me is the Story Mode. The clone story was a lazy direction. If you want to make a DBZ fighting game story where you are dealing with legions of ""no-name"" henchmen and baddies, you have Red Ribbon Army members, Siebermen, Freiza's troops, or Cell babies. Instead you fight clones of a portion of an already limited roster of characters for hours. I quickly forgave this laziness, because I saw the potential in the Leveling System. Imagining that eventually I'll take on a Level 80 Majin Buu, being called upon to manage my 8-11 characters regarding remaining HP, Level, Team Moves, and Special Perks strategically. Feeling like a leader of a team of Z Fighters trying to somehow combat a single god-like super-villain. The way this game is built, that would have been easy and just a matter of RPG math. At Level 80, Buu can take alot of damage at 800,000 HP, has his own Special Perks, can take you down in 5 Light Attacks, on top of that has good AI that the game already has at Max Difficulty. Either you have to play perfectly or grind to get to Level 80 too. I think the online ""Party Battle"" gives you this David vs Goliath experience to an extent, but you have to wait every 70 hours for it because it's considered a ""Special Event"".  So there is no difficulty setting for Story mode, nor a way to control Enemy Levels, only too accept the game's long, lazy, repetitive, and insultingly easy Story campaign. The boardgame-like mechanic of progression is nonsensical and impossible to run out of moves/time to get to the next chapter. And don't get me started on the focus on Avatars, Banners, and Stamps. Another concern is the vanilla and DLC character roster of various levels of Super Saiyen of the SAME DUDE, with the slightest differences, being treated as a totally separate character. You can simply Super Saiyen his butt with the color options, because that's all it is, colors and skins.

54523849,english,"Amazingly awesome fighting game, and also awesome dragon ball game. 

The only issues I have are on netplay, the arena matches are broken, and at certain hours there aren't many people playing, but the game's far from dead.

The  AI is quite decent on hard dificulty arcade mode, but of course nothing in comparison to what a skilled player can do. Still, it's a joy to fight even against the pc-if only to enjoy looking at superiorly animated characters and attack sequences which frankly speaking surpass the level of animation in dragonball super anime and give me that dragonball Z nostalgia that recent animations failed to deliver.

 The single player story is a masterpiece of writing by dragonball's standarts(read:it's medicore), and just like a dragonball story should, it has tiny bits of plot in between tedious filler of fighting mute clone mobs, which made finishing all three storylines quite a drag tbh. still if you're a little bit of completionist, like myself, it takes about 9 hours to finish all storylines and get the coressponding unlocks and achievements, and about another 9 hours to get the remaining achievements, except for zeni and bp grinding which im yet to obtain(fortunatley the game is really generous on zeni just two days ago i got 300 thousand just for logging in). 

Speaking of bp, it s a rank point system you get for fighting ranked matched. You get a lot of bp for winning, you lose some bp for losing. As long as you don't lose all the time your bp count should be steadly increasing. Players are matched based on same bp rank or higher if the player wishes so, so you don't need to worry about being randomly matched with someone who outclasses you greatly. 

In the beginning it might seem like combat is just button mashing and inputing same combos over and over again, and you might even think that ""every character plays the same""(a complaint i saw in several reviews under this game) but this mindest will soon change after you start being paired up with more advanced players.  The combo key inputs might be more or else the same for every character, but what each character does during these inputs is often extremly different, and all that makes game easy to learn but hard to master.",1565299935,1565299935,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,511,178,1898,0,1626,1565730582

The art style is simply amazingly stylised to fit DB's bright and colourful style in the anime, and a joy to watch the super moves and cinematic finishes every time. The wide array of characters and making lesser characters more unique and cinematic is interesting to see, although I'd like maybe one LESS Goku and Vegeta, and the fact that DLC characters were announced on day one is a *BIG THINK* it doesn't de-value the characters any less.

The main mode people play is online of course but the story mode has really cool interactions and conversations between the classic characters is a delight, however the gameplay of the story is ehhh grindy and kinda redundant.

54384147,english,"I love dragonball Z but I was always booty cheeks at Xenoverse. so for the longest time, I had wanted a game that I could excel at that could make me feel like I was actually in control of my favorite characters. When this game, a 2D fighter was announced, I was ecstatic. Because I had been playing fighting games my whole life but the 3D arena fighter I just couldn’t wrap my head around. When I got my hands on this game, the controls felt crisp and responsive unlike xenoverse. the combos are long, and actually do simultate how the characters themselves fight in the anime and manga and the super moves are spectacular. This game is easy to learn and Hard to master. I appreciate the devs putting in auto combos for the newer player but the mechanics require that for some extremely hard hitting combos, your going to have to utilize some of those auto combo mechanics to send your combos into the higher digit hit counts. However, every game isn’t without its faults. To make it easy for you I’ll list the pros and cons of the game below.

Pros:
Colorful...Every color on every character is accurate and the artstyle is amazing. Since Dragonball is a 2D anime, it fits much better here then it does on Xenoverse.

Hype...after a great practice session and learning a brand new high damaging combos, it feels so amazing to go into a multiplayer match and show your opponent that new combo you’ve practiced so much. It actually does make you feel like Goku after stepping out of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber with your new found power. It makes you feel so proud of yourself.

Style...The best part of the mechanics system in this game is that there isn’t a set combo your forced to do or else. Absolutely not...This game allows you to customize your own combos in order to get absurd amounts of damage or just to style on your opponent.

Character Selection...The amount of characters in this game is fair. However the majority of the big names in dragonball are here: Krillin, Goku, Vegeta, Frieza the Androids etc. This allows you to finally create that dream team you’ve always wanted to see in the anime and put them up against other peoples dream teams

Music...all of your favorite tracks from both Dragonball, Z and Super are here and it just adds to the hype being able to fight along to best tracks in the series.

Character Diversity...Every character doesn’t play the same. Every character has their own unique playstyle and archetype that make him weak and excel in different situations. Taking this into account when creating your squad is definitely important. Even though most characters do have the same BnB combos, their special moves and mobility is really what makes every character. 

Dramatic/Destructive Finishes...If your able to finish off an opponent character with a certain special move, it triggers a cinematic that can show replays of iconic moments from the anime or just all around incredible destructive power. Nothings better than completing a flashy combo on an opponent and then letting Vegeta disintegrate his opponent, and half the planet with his Final Flash..Gets me everytime.

Cons
(Please forgive me on this section but I have much more to say about the cons of this game because both this game and Dragonball in general is very sacred to me so I take these points personally. This doesn’t mean that these points carry more weight then the Pros)

Multiplayer...now, please understand that when I say “Multiplayer” I’m talking about the “OTHER PLAYERS.” Due to this I’m going to split this point up into 2 different sections:

Tier Whoring: 

Unfortunatly, this is still a fighting game, and that means that the majority of players you face online aren’t going to be Dragon Ball fans. Most of the time, you’ll be facing hardcore fighting game fans who see this game as their ticket to EVO. Because of this, you’ll see a lot of “Tier whoring” as we call it in the Fighting game community (FGC). This refers to the act of a player who simply chooses a team full of the best characters in the game. Even professional players are guilty of this. This can lead to a lot of anger for the other player as they are constantly seeing the same 5 or 6 characters in multiplayer when the roster has anywhere from 15-20 playable characters.

This particular point is what bothers me the most about this game mostly because Arc System Works did their absolute best to make this game FROM Dragon Ball Fans FOR Dragon Ball fans, and unfortunately, it’s been infested with the low lives of the FGC community that couldn’t give less of a shit about dragon ball. People that probably haven’t even seen a single episode of Dragonball; all they see is another fighting game to practice on.

Rage Quitting

Although there are some penalties for rage quitting, it hasn’t been enough to discourage players from doing it; ESPECIALLY in casual matches. If your kicking your opponents ass, or maybe win a scramble you probably weren’t supposed to, don’t be surprised if your opponent disconnects. This has become worse in accordance with my last point. People at this point are tired of seeing the same 5 characters in multiplayer. SO...I’ve seen matches where players will disconnect at the LOADING screen because they just don’t feel like playing an opponent whose going to Tier Whore.

Lack of Respect for Characters
This point may seem a bit odd for some, but for me it's kinda personal. This ALSO reverts back to the Tier whoring point. This game has a variety of different characters in it varying from earlier in the series to characters we were just introduced to. In accordance with that, it is extremely hard to watch characters who are notoriously powerful in the anime and manga get absolutely curb stomped in this game specifically because of the way they were designed in the game. FOR EXAMPLE:

Bardock Vs. God of Destruction Beerus

On paper, this shouldn’t even be a contest. Lord Beerus is an actual GOD in the dragonball series that was introduced to Goku as his next milestone of power he was supposed to aspire to. Bardock on the other hand was a low class saiyan warrior who at the time of his death couldn’t overpower 1st Form Frieza. Now before I sound like too much of a weeb here let me make my point. Bardock in the anime and manga, is the weakest of the weak, Lord Beerus on the other hand is supposed to be the Strongest of the strong. Unfortunately, in Fighterz, it's the opposite. 9 times out of 10 a Bardock in game will absolutely destroy a Beerus just due to the matchups, mechanics comparison and overall combo potential.
 
This isn’t the only example I could give you. There are plenty of notoriously powerful characters in the anime that are on the lower end of the totem pole Tier wise in this game and there are plenty of weaker and obsolete characters that top the charts in this game, Bardock, Yamcha, Android 16 (Pre-Patch) are examples of this. It doesn’t have to do necessarily with damage output but overall mechanics and what each character brings to the team

Bardock: a combo monster, amazing assist, wake up options, double super options, In the air and on ground lvl 1-3 ultimate moves. Amazing damage output, auto combo that can combo you anywhere at anytime with no risk of dropping.

 Kid Buu: Extreme range on normals, unbelievable mixup potential, almost completely safe on all normals and specials. Assist locks you down for about 3 seconds, instant air dash monster

SS Vegeta: Even after many nerfs his assist is still one of the best in the game regarding lockdowns and “get out of jail free” potential

Cell: Again, even after nerfs, Cell still has some of the best corner potential in the game

Saiyan Saga Vegeta: unbelievable corner pressure and combo potential, Instant air dash monster

Videl: Not played as much anymore due to her demanding inputs and execution but still more mechanically sound then most low tier characters and still an absolute terror in the hands of a skilled player.

First the bad, the Varying degrees of different running frame rates even though it is running at 60, the models during cutscenes specifically are running at around 15fps with everything else in the background including aura effects running at 60fps this can induce heavy eyestrain for people that experience major simulation sickness, for those that have never experienced what simulation sickness feels like, for some people it can feel like being car sick, among others though it can induce migraines and eyestrain that feels like someone is taking a needle to your eye and sticking it in. 
This is a bad design decision that can exclude a minority that just wants to enjoy a game. While actually playing the meat of the game being the fighting, I didn't feel as bad so perhaps I just need to avoid playing the story, still this is something that can't be tolerated and developers should take a page from this if they don't want to make people with simulation sickness unwell.

Now the good, The responses are very snappy, and it's very easy to pick up, I assume it's low skill floor while a high skill mastery, for those that don't experience simulation sickness this is definently a easy game to recommend, however for people that do experience simulation sickness you should consider whether or not this is a series you can enjoy, if you don't you may want to avoid it.",1562413662,1562413662,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,475,1,75,0,21,1569181153

53772196,english,"If you're a fighting game newbie this is probably the game you should start with, as I hear this is one of the easier ones. (this is my case).

I did initially have a rough start and thought about refunding the game but after giving it a bit more time I *really* got into it and here I am now.

Yes, it might feel very frustrating fighting opponents that easily destroy you but you could take them as insipration to get better.

About the DLC characters, they aren't a must - some of them are very powerful and unique but personally I find myself always ending up with a team made out of the original roster.

My only issue with the DLC characters is that you can't test them in training mode before you buy them (you can use Ginyu's body swap in arcade mode to give them a quick test but that's quite a hassle).

Anyway, even after....700 hours? I'm *still* having a lot of fun, it almost never gets boring - I am definitely recommending this.

The only thing that this game is lacking is a more tradicional menu system. I mean the lobby thing is good and all but it's just a bit confusing, but if you press LT you'll go to a simple menu that will take you instantly to wherever you wanna go so there you go.

Could use some more fighting lobbys. I'm from Portugal, I have connected to Spain but there are 0 players around. Connected a second time to the UK and it's just too full... So online play is out for now. (Update: Games don't come easy but there's a lot more rooms now and the lobby system is much better!)

53297715,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is a fantastic game. As someone who grew up reading the original Dragon Ball manga and watching the original DBZ anime, DBFZ makes for a genuine nostalgia trip. The gameplay is smooth, easy to pick up and play but difficult to master. Moves like ""Goodbye Tien"" made me especially nostalgic. Hearing Tien yell ""CHOWTZUUUU"" as Chiaotzu sacrifices himself is too good. 

The story mode is great imo. It's a bit repetitive and easy but it's still more than serviceable. Lots of great character moments, quips and callbacks that will make fans of Dragon Ball Z very happy. All of the characters look super good and the voice acting is phenomenal as well. 

So essentially, I'm happy with the game's single player content. I wish there was a bit more variety and substance but it's definitely passable and worth the $20 I spent. I obviously have to touch on the online. At first I absolutely loved it. My first 10 matches were really fun. I destroyed 4 of my first 5 matches and then got destroyed 4 of the next 5. The guy I was vsing was brand new and so was I. It was an even, fun match. Because I'm in Australia and it's 18 months after launch, the player base I can be matched with is extremely small. Like, I've played on 4 separate days and only been matched with 4 different people small. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th players were all drastically more experienced than me by a magnitude of 100+ hours. Needless to say, I got bodied nearly every match. 

Sooo online is pretty hit or miss. There's also the classic fighting game player who will leave right before you beat them in casual and ranked matches. But I digress. It's not so much a problem with the game but rather the community and lack of player base. If you're looking for online, I suggest you be American or European and preferably be living in Europe or America.

I tried 100 times until i got ONE. I heard that PlayStation controller it's better than Xbox controller for this game. Maybe thats the issue? I play other games like Yakuza 0 with my Xbox One controller for PC and no problem. The response is smooth in other games but in DBFZ the movement joystick is terrible. Jump and crouch are ok but my character doesn't dash forward or backward. He just walks xD. This makes imposible to do some of the combos for me. In the other hand the cross worked amazingly good with the movement. My character dashed back and forward but now the combos are more difficult to do than before (cross for movement and joystick for combos, what a mess). I really don't know how people can play this.

53001258,english,"[u]Pros[/u] 
- Generally balanced characters and gameplay.  While there are characters like Bardock, Cell, Yamcha and Super Saiyan Goku who are quite powerful and do well competitively, casual play allows you to build just about any team of whatever characters you like and still perform decently.  You'll never really feel like you're losing simply because a character is too weak.

- Plenty of gameplay depth while being easy to pick up.  The game is simple on the surface, but you'll eventually have to practice certain combos and techniques in order to play on par with competent players.  Training mode is essential and that's how it should be.

- Amazing visuals using the same game engine as Guilty Gear Xrd.  Every character is perfectly rendered and animated along with plenty of fan service in their moves that directly reference the original manga and anime.

- Good variety of characters.  Just about all of the major fighters from most of the Dragonball Z and Dragonball Super sagas are playable.

- Good player base on PC makes it easy to find matches online.  You'll usually be able to find a casual matches anytime you play.

- Good soundtrack with each character having their own unique theme that can be played in place of the stages original stage music.

[u]Cons[/u] 
- Some game mechanics can bog the game down and make matches drag on a bit too long.  Sparking in particular allows quick health regeneration in addition to being a pretty reliable defensive mechanic (similar to burst is Guilty Gear or Blaze Blue).  While this makes it a useful tool it also slows the pace of the match at times.

- Some characters benefit greatly from the auto combo mechanic, like Bardock who's auto combo is a good anti air.  Auto combos also auto correct, meaning if the opponent goes behind you while performing it, your character will automatically turn around and continue their attack rather than face the same direction.  A mechanic like this rewards players for simply mashing a single button without any consideration for what way their characters face.

- The ""Super-dash"" mechanic discourages any sort of in depth neutral play or zoning in favor of every character having a rush down move that can lead to a strong combo.  While it's not unbeatable and can be anti-aired and countered, this becomes increasingly difficult the closer you are to the opponent.  A lot of the time neutral comes down to who performed a super-dash first, and discourages players from using other tools like projectiles and special attacks.  Super-dash also negates normal projectiles, so they become a lot less useful as a result.  Zoning in this game is generally not a viable strategy.

-Netplay is a step down from previous Arc Sys fighting games.  You cannot make player lobbies, making playing with friends or a group of players online inconvenient.  If you're not playing ranked or casual matches and being paired up automatically, prepare to be disappointed.

-Lots of Gokus and Vegetas.  While this doesn't bother me specifically, some players may not like that Goku and Vegeta have a lot of representation in the roster representing their various forms from the series.  Goku alone has 4 different character variations not counting Goku Black and Bardock who are almost visually identical.

Overall the game is still worth playing, especially at a casual level.  Despite its flaws it may still be the most competent Dragonball fighting game ever created.

Its amazing as a Dragon Ball game in its fan service, animations, art everything. This game is gorgeous. This game screams, ""Play me, I look fucking amazing."" Definitely did something right there.

Ever felt hesitant about buying a fighter game, because you might suck at it, because you do not have a controller, or because the game requires super hard combo's for you to use?

If that's the case, DRAGON BALL FighterZ is the game for you.

DRAGON BALL FighterZ is a game that is essentially easy to learn, but give it some room and it becomes a game that is very hard to master. I myself play with an keyboard, and found it hard at first, give it some time and even with a keyboard, you can do all the combo's you desperately want to.

You do NOT need a controller to play this game, the default keybinds for keyboard are good enough. Obviously, if you want tho change your keybinds, feel free to do so, nobody is stopping you, right?

You can have a windows vista PC and still run this game on the max settings, this game is optimized in.. one of the best ways. No matter if you have a Potato PC, you can still run this beauty with no problem at all.

This game ALSO has a very good OST. Especially one that will give nostalgia if you are a DBZ fan in general.

As mentioned before, this game is a MUST for all the DBZ fans out there. I do have to say that.. putting some of the characters behind paywalls is a shit move, but.. i totally understand that Bandai did this. Gotta make money /shrug

Overall, really nice game, nice story, amazing visuals and OST. And ofcourse the classic DBZ Cast.

That being said, mechanically, the game is great. Visually wonderful. You can tell a lot of love went into this project. The voice acting is done by the cast of the anime, which is spot on. The story is okay, but it's impressive how long it is. Highly unusual for a fighting game to have a story as long or in depth as this one is, so even if you're not one of those people who is into online play, there is plenty there for you.

 I had a bit of trouble getting my stick to work at first, but steam has upgraded their controller compatibility. No issues anymore.

Netcode is passable for the most part. occasional hiccup playing with someone in the same city as me, but for the most part, I haven't run into many laggy matches. It's nice that there is a large player base, so it's fairly easy to find people at your skill level.

51558806,english,"I'm tired, guys.

I'm tired of getting frame-hacked by Vegito and Gohan.
I'm tired of getting poked by cheeky scrubs who secretly have no clue what they're doing.
I'm tired of the disrespect by aerial launching after death.
I'm tired of lag always favoring the enemy and never me.
I'm tired of being minus on block in every situation no matter what I do.
I'm tired of being yellow and fighting pink players in Casual.
I'm tired of the smartest AI using the medium auto-combo.
I'm tired of Adult Gohan just existing in general.
I'm tired of Videl players thinking her voice actor is any good.

I'm never playing online again. It is the single most biased, unfair online I have ever played in a fighting game, and I fought Bayonetta back when Smash 4 was big. Combat is repetitive and analyzed, and it's only flashy and exciting if you have amazing connection or are playing offline. AI is stupid, especially in Story Mode which is basically a button masher if you can time it right, so offline is no fun. You can't even get Dramatic Finish over and over because the AI is just an impenetrable wall of block half the time unless you cheese them with ki blasts, which might not work if they're at low health, which you'll want them to be.

Story Mode isn't much better. Fighting clone after clone while having characters talking about clone after clone. Sure, there's some funny banter (especially pairing Nappa with Cell), but it's few and far between. And the linking system didn't feel immersive or special, just extremely homosexual. And the villain? Android 21? Boring. Boring and underdeveloped. They hyped her up to be this threatening new foe, but she just amounts to a female Cell. Her personality isn't much better, either. She has two halves, both of which are dumpster fires in execution. Her good half is just Tsubaki Yayoi with a doctorate, and her evil half is just Himiko Toga with a vore fetish. Both bland and tasteless, ironically enough. The only people who are going to like her are the Rule 34 artists and the people who get paid to say they like Dragon Ball. The endings suck, too. The Super Warrior ending feels unsatisfying, and the Enemy Warrior ending is a cliffhanger for some reason, but the Android 21 ending is by far the worst of them all. For those who don't know, Goku chucks a Spirit Bomb at Evil 21, but she's too powerful for some reason. So Good 21 has to sacrifice herself to kill her off. This should have spared Good 21 since Spirit Bombs cannot harm good-natured souls, but for some reason she also dies. Whis goes on about her being a slave to her vore fetish, even though the whole arc is about her overcoming it. And then Goku pulls the Uub card on her by getting King Yemma to reincarnate her, even though that's the worst thing that can happen for everyone. Oh, and if you're wondering what 16 has to say, he doesn't. 21 kills him in all three storylines. He's not even the real 16. He was rebuilt, only to be destroyed later. So he has basically zero purpose in the plot, and his inclusion and relation to 21 is just an excuse to put him in the base game.

I cannot stress this enough. Only, and I mean [b] [i] ONLY [/i] [/b] get this game if you sincerely don't give a single solitary damn about online play. Online play picks favorites. Either you got it, or you don't. It's unforgiving, and it's not fun unless you're the one winning. It's never fair or challenging. Either you win by a landslide, or you get your own butt handed to you on a silver platter. And if you're in the latter category, suck it up. Deal with it. Like I have.

51152768,english,"DB FighterZ is a 2D fighting gaming. I am a big Dragonball since the original show with Kid Goku. I played most of the DB Games since Budokai 1. This is the second biggest let-down since the ‘Super Dragon Ball Z’ game, but it has some good aspects.

Good:
+ excellent graphics and visuals. The best DBZ game so far in this aspect. Most accurate portrayal of the manga stil.
+ excellent fan service – character poses, stances, moves and facial expressions are all matching the manga
+ unique character dialogues are funny and consistent with the lore
+ story is not excellent but good for a dragonball game. It's not only the retelling of the saiyan to boo arc. Unique and self-containing story arc.
+ fast paced action brawling – you can feel the DBZ speed
+ voice actor's are doing a great job - very authentic

Neutral:
= Roster selection is questionable - Yamcha is in but no Kid Trunks or Goten
= Dialoge options during the story mode fells weird
= Adding of skill/perks – like extra damage, health regeneration or exp after the fight

Bad:
- You will begin to use only very few combos and mash them again and again.
- No real individual transformation which stays in that form until Ki runs out - exception is Freeza with his Golden From.
  Transformations are mostly part of a combo and last a few seconds
- 2 season passes for characters (cash-grab) - than you get double characters e.g. 2x Broly’s (1x DBZ & 1x DBS), even if they have different move- and skill-sets
- All the maps in the story mode always have the same clone fights over and over again
- CPU / AI is very often extermly dull
- Similar “story mode” mechanic than in Budokai 2 where you move your figure across a “board-map”.  Why did they not fully animate the story, instead we only get the few gorgous animated cutscenes during or after eventful fights.

Conclusion:
I can't recommand this game. Story mode is always same clone fights, AI is stupid, no real transformation mechanic like in older DB games - like the great Budokai 3 or Budokai Tenkaichi 3.",1560156796,1560164374,FALSE,5,3,0.394048214,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,498,32,1621,0,1621,1559854578

However, I played online match only and it was against a living legend ( basically like a diamond+ level player) and got destroyed by him. It is impossible to find matches on the Canadian west coast online for whatever reason and especially impossible when trying to find someone that's around your skill level if you're just starting out.

Regardless of that it is the best party fighting game of all time and I strongly recommend you buy it and play it with your friends. You can forget about ranked and casual play online because the party mode totally makes up for that.

Should you buy this game for 80 CAD? 
No. Wait for a steam sale.
Also all DLC is another ~40$

if you want an ""accessible"" fighting game play SFV or wait for GBV.

One of the best dragon ball games even (in my opinion) better than the dragon ball budokai tenkaichi 3 has nice graphics that work well for my PC and my pc is a bad low resource pc etc ... the characters are well designed along with the words that will say at the beginning of each fight and the scenarios give you even more life than the game can have because the scenario is interactive because thanks to this you can send a character from one stage to another, you can finish the characters with the scenario and even if the fight is too aggressive or epic the stage will be destroyed with a spectacular animation, but not everything in this game is good because unfortunately the characters in this game are very few and the story mode is too repetitive because only be based on killing clones again and again until you get to the boss of each phase as well as not to forget the so hated DLC because in this game you have too many DLC to choose to buy the Fighter Pass or co to buy the characters one by one and to say that both options are not cheap especially the Fighter Pass, how many Gokus are there in this game 1? ... 2? nope there are 4 gokus of which 2 are paid, I only recommend this game to people who really like dragon ball and play without DLC because there are many characters and as human beings we are obviously going to want

50652558,english,"I love this game. I'm recommending this game due to it being very approachable to players of all skill levels as well as it being done by Arc System Works. Also for several other reasons but I'm going to list these due to them being my stronger reasons.

1. A TUTORIAL MODE!! This game has a tutorial mode to help grasp the basics of the game and get ya started as well as making the game approachable.

2. The game's structure for combos and gameplay is well balanced and very easy to just pick up and play.

3. Has a very deep structure to the gameplay and combos for your more competitive scene players as well as something for new players to strive for.

4. It has IN-GAME FRAME DATA!! Not many fighting games do this and I'm so glad that FighterZ has done this (although it took a year but, better than never). This allows player to get better at the game without having to hit Google and Youtube real hard.

5. Its fucking Dragonball fellas. If you're a fan of the series you're gonna love this game, even more so if you love fighting games.

6. A FUCKING TUTORIAL MODE!!

Now there are a few niche complaints from me about it, but I'm able to look past them a bit and they shouldn't be takin' too seriously due to them not ruining the entire experience of the game for me. Then again its up to your preference if it deters you from gettin' it.

1. RAGE QUITTERS are not penalized for shit. As well as you won't get the win or Battle Points (BP) to rank up in Ranked if they rage quit before the K.O.

2. A lot of representation of Goku in the game. Goku SS, Goku SSB, Goku Base, Goku GT. There could've been a different way to approach this, but I'm not sure. I just know we didn't need 4 different iterations of Goku taking up character slots. 

3. The game is a bit slow on the uptake when it comes to balance patches and other things. The Game is getting more and more balanced as well as tuned, but its quite slow to do so.

Overall I give the game a 9 out of 10 and highly recommend to players who love Dragonball, fighting games, and new players who want to start their first fighting game.",1557904696,1557904696,TRUE,4,0,0.545930684,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,91,4,7024,0,3549,1582663185

39731367,english,"DRAGON BALL FighterZ is a fantastic fighting game whether you're a beginner or an expert. With automatic combos and flashy cinematics to make newcomers feel like badasses and a deep system for 'true' combos that veteran fighting game players will enjoy, this game seems to have successfully bridged the gap between casual and competitive.

Every special move in the game is a quarter-circle forward or back and then one button press. That may seem like a turn-off to some, but understand that the game's rich combo system more than makes up for it. No amount of dash spamming or auto-comboing will let a newbie cheap out a good player, and that's where I think this game truly succeeds.

The story is pretty decent, too. Don't expect anything great, as it's very derivative, but that's what most should expect when picking up a game with the Dragon Ball name. The first arc is a glorified tutorial and isn't especially good, the second arc is substantially better, and the third arc is the only one with any true character progression behind it. Android 21 starts off feeling like a fanfiction character but definitely comes into her own by the end of the story.

I'm also with the majority of DBZ fans in preferring the English dub to the Japanese due to certain voices just sounding.. off (70 year old woman Goku, generic bad guy Cell, etc), but certain voices in the dub definitely underperform. Vegeta's battle lines sound a little goofy, and Android 21's voice actress sounds like she's never had a villain role before in her life. Either way, both choices are solid and don't matter too much to begin with.

Story Mode:IT JUST SUCKS,ahem to describe it you just fight clones over and over again.Thats it.Its boring and a time wasting mode.The story itself isnt good either.

Party Mode:Now this mode is fun.you can do 3v3 with 6 people.And you can do raid missions (they come once in a month)the problem is you will hardly find any party mode lobbies (except raids)

Gameplay:Now this is the part where everything gets horribly cheesy.Its unbalanced.Every character has some moves that puts others to shame.Auto combos just sucks ass (AHEM BARDOCK AHEM AHEM)Look into tier list before making a team because you will get manhandled.And doing combos is ridiculously easy and this makes characters even more broken.Oh btw dont even try playing this game with a keyboard.You will have a hard time learning anything.

Online:SERVERS ARE GODDAMN HORRIBLE!Sometimes you lost connection to server for no fucking reason and sometimes while searching for an opponent you wont even find one.And they should stop with this interactive online menu bs already.

Microtransactions:SERIOUSLY?!2.50 DOLARS FOR EACH CHARACTER?WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS?AND THE DLCS SUCK TOO,BASE GOKU,BASE VEGETA AND A ANOTHER GODDAMN GOKU AS A DLC?ADD CHARACTER WHO IS WORTH BEING A DLC

Overall dont buy this game unless there is a sale.This game isnt worth of being 39 dolars folks.Its not the best db game,It sure as hell isnt the best fighting game

The actual fighting game play is both fun to play and watch. But that's where the fun ends. The online options for play are severely limited by an ill-conceived lobby system. The netcode still needs work as well. There's no telling how long it may take to find a match during peak hours (If there's a port that needs to be open - I am still unaware of it), and if your opponent is even fun to play against. They may even choose to drop after the first match as well, plunging you back into the abyss of wait times.

The single player experience, in theory, should make up for this in some regard. It does not. Arcade mode rely's on artificial difficulty ramping (More HP, Damage, Meter Gain for CPU) instead of utilizing a more skilled AI. The single player tournament mode confirms that there's a high difficulty AI - and while it may never compare to a player, it still cheapens the experience of the Arcade which yields rewards to be spent on unlockables.

Finally, there is too much repetitious use of Goku as a character. With such a wide range of characters in the Dragon Ball universe they could have branched out much further.

100% TOD combo with 0 bar is a broken game. There is no skill other than learning how to 100% combo which is muscle memory not skill. Dodging and countering is skill but very little is needed if you learn how to 100% which than this game becomes a 1 sided game with no balance... I am VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED in this game

Older Review
This game supports controllers now it seems. I am switching this negative view back to a positive one. The one gripe I have with this game after playing many hours is the lack of combo breaking. I have seen some people do 90% damage to someone as a combo. That should never happen IMO. You should be able to break out of combos after ""X"" amount of damage to prevent this",1517114329,1555389144,FALSE,0,0,0.417910159,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,286,15,3857,0,2531,1549429943

FighterZ is a gorgeous looking game that has obviously has a lot of love put into it. It's easy to pick up for newcomers to the fighting genre yet still offers a high skill ceiling as a result of the 3v3 fighter mechanic. The story is repetitive yet there are some neat little interactions between characters.

[b] Main Review: [/b]

[u] Core Fighting Mechanics: [/u]

I'm not a seasoned veteran of fighting games. In fact in the community I might just manage to scratch into being called average. So take what I say with a dose of salt if you are deep into the FGC.

The basic fighting mechanics are easy to pick up. You pick three characters for each match. The move pool for each character is a bit smaller than most games but this is made up with the massive options for interactions between the characters as you switch in for assists and super moves. The sparking mechanic that adds a bit of healing to the game allows for some great close matches and comebacks. The game is filled with what are called auto-combos where a repeated button press will launch a flashy combo. As you progress you'll learn to interrupt these basic combos with teleports and ground slams in order to get of super moves. You'll intersperce the combos with some of the basic special moves and for a while as you learn the opponents animations and this will be enough. Then you'll learn about manuals and how to do jump cancels to extend combos and use assists for denials and further extensions. Then you'll spend time learning each of the characters strengths and the roles they play in teams.

There is a very high skill ceiling to this game and it is still  one of the easiest games to get started in.

[u] Visuals [/u]

What can I say. The trailers and footage speaks for itself. Visually speaking this game is a near masterpiece. It captures the exuberance and power from the show and manga so effortlessly. Special beams and moves are animated with such care and attention to detail seeing all the little details while you play is a joy in and of itself. Each character feels utterly different to play just because of how they have managed to capture fighting styles direct from the show.

[u] Story [/u]

The story is the biggest let down in the game. Its fairly generic and the campaign itself is very repetitive having you fight shadow clone after shadow clone. The tutorial also needlessly drags on and repeats itself. The saving grace to the story is that it is full of these little moments of character interaction that is driven byt the characters you choose to have on your team leading to some interesting and unexpected moments.

[u] Misc Features [/u]

The menu is set in a little arena where you run around as miniature versions of the shows characters. You have options for story, and ranked and casual multiplayer as expected. You also have arcade mode which is a challenge of increasingly difficult AI in a row. You also have a local multiplayer area which has most of the customisation options you normally get such as round length and tournament brackets.

For other multiplayer options you can set up little rooms in this hub where people can join and spectate and participate in winner stays on matches. There is also a public fighting ring in each lobby where other members can join and fight but this mostly goes unused.

There are no microtransactions in the game. The game rewards you with a currency which can be used to buy capsules that contain random cosmetics for your lobby character. Any repeats  you get net you with a secondary currency that can be used to buy a capsule that guarantees no duplicates.

[u] DLC/Patches [/u]

So far there there is one completed season of characters and a second ongoing season. These characters have been good additions to the game with them all having unique play styles and feeling different to play. And with these characters have come some necessary balancing to the characters overtime to buff here and nerf there. As someone who isn't skilled enough I can't comment on how balanced the game currently is but there has been a decent amount of updates that have been addressing balance issues.

[u] Conclusion [/u]

""Unreal Engine crash, the game is gonna close now""

11/10 would start up again.

I'm curious how this game looks in 4k with the crappy resolution artwork (already hurts my eyes in 1080p).

Also crappy, mediocre characters artwork. Needs revamp. Like. MAD.

If you are used to ArcSystemWorks's fighting games, go buy it.

If you come from Namco, SNK, Capcom, LabZero or anyone else, avoid this game.

Why? Because you'll just feel it's a DragonBall-skinned Guilty Gear XRD.

Why does ASW think it's cool to have 30fps or less animations in a 60fps enviroment escapes my mind. Also hurts my eyes and why Guilty Gear XRD didn't got my attention.

Not a bad game, but RPG elements in a fighting game...? C'mon........

""Unreal Engine crash, the game is gonna close now""

Que rayos con esto? 11/10 lo iniciarian de nuevo.

Me da curiosidad de como se ve el artwork de baja resolucion en 4k... (de entrada ya me lastima los ojos tan solo en 1080p)

Tambien el artwork de los personajes esta muy qlero, mediocre. Necesitan volver a trabajarlo, pero maaaaal.

Si estas acostumbrado a los juegos de pelea de ArcSystemWorks, compralo.

Si venis de SNK, Capcom, Namco, LabZero u otros, evita comprarlo.

Por que? Por que lo notaras como un copy-paste del Guilty Gear XRD.

Por que AWS piensa que animaciones de 30fps o menos se ven bien cool en un ambiente de 60fps (o sea, todo el resto esta a 60fps, incluido transiciones, zooming, etc). Tambien me lastima los ojos. Por eso mismo deje de prestarle atencion al Guilty Gear Xrd.

Also Andriod 21 being locked behind the storymode... cmon man why? Also incentive to spend money.

This is my biggest concern with this game. Its just so bloody obvious that its a cashgrab yet people keep paying (vote with your wallet) so nothing will change and that, for me, is a really frustraiting thing. As i dont like this new standerd. 

So, rant about money is over (and if you are just a Dragonball fan, dont get this game if you dont like the pricing as other content is laking!) so whats next?

Story mode. Hiding Android 21 behind a 6-8hour grind in storymode is beyond godlike retarded. The story is actually kind of fun (wont spoil a thing, dont wurry) but all the meaningless stuff in between just makes it a grind. And with a competative game having 21 behind such a grindwall hurts the game. 

Other thing i dislike is arcade mode for Goku/Vegeta blue. This is such a grind and multiple people rater pay than to play this mode. Yes people are lazy but if it was fun people woudnt complain about it as much. BUT ITS NOT FUN AT ALL. Its a shame that such a fun fighter has such shity modes.

Low character count was mentioned before but will mention it again: Its low. Base game 60 bucks and so few? With 3 even being locked?! Day1 DLC characters anounced (which are only 8...)?!?! Not a good thing again.

So, Dragonball lovers, dont buy. Fighting game lovers? GET IT!

I am ashamed to say it but if you like fighting games this is a good grab. Like all the things i mentioned above about story and arcade, you dont care for it anyway. Bots are decent enough for warmup and the lader is good. Matchmaking is decent (penalty system not harsh enough) and they are activly working on improving the loby system. Only thing that will hinder you is the character stuff i mentioned before. So be prepared to spend around 100-150 on this game if you want to stay competative (which sucks).


All in all i am happy but i know the game is overpriced. So i am, ashamed to say, part of the problem.",1517341508,1553356387,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,80,19,2836,0,2743,1532646982
49676286,english,"A review from someone that is slowly coming up on 100 hours in this game.
Dragon ball fighterz is a 3vs3 anime style fighter with a heavy emphasis on offence, you will spend most of your time vanishing, super dashing, and getting down heavied. For the first 30 or so hours of the game you will, at least in my experience, be completely shit a wont win a single online match against anyone with a colour higher than blue (this a colour based system showing how well you do against players of the same rank: blue bad light blue mediocre green/light green medium yellow ok orange good pink great). This game is primarily you training to get better at online matches over a long period of time, if this isn't your kind of thing then this game isn't for you, as the story and arcade are lackluster at best. The menu is fairly unintuitive (a lobby rather than regular menu), but this setup works well for online as you can challenge other players to ring matches, and have short conversations via the z-stamps and emotes. The netcode is solid and the online matches, that the game is so geared towards are very good, though don't expect anything less than at least 2 frames worth of delay for most matches, also if your opponent rage quits at the end of a ranked match (if you've already killed them) then you will still be awarded a win, which is nice. It would also be nice if the ps4 controller was fully supported in terms of button prompts etc, and the monetization strategy of multiple season passes is abhorent, and if i wasn't so invested in the game, I wouldn't even participate in it.
Overall apart from a few grevences this game is brilliant, if you like the online aspect of fighting games, and are willing to re-learn you neutral game (if you play other fighters).

TL;DR
Good online, beautiful graphics, ok music, terrible dlc practices(it's a fighting game what do you expect), easy to learn for new comers to fighting games

The factor that separates it from the average fighting game is the speed. Super Dashing makes it fast to close the gap between you and your opponent, not coming without risk of course. Plus, you don't have to spend your time learning all these insane commands to pull off supers. Unlike in other games, the challenge isn't pulling off the super attacks, but using them in the best way possible. Using your assists to set up combos using your supers, or even chaining your supers to theirs is also a major part of the game.
Matchmaking is quick, modes are all a lot of fun (including the ones that have unfortunately been deserted due to the playerbase declining), and each character feels completely different in terms of weight, height, mobility, abilities and how their combos suit you.

49205429,english,"Yes he could have. The original Funimation dub stated that Kid Buu was stronger than Super Buu, but that was only a line in the dub. The truth is that while it’s not outright stated, Kid Buu is the second weakest form of Majin Buu.

Goku stated that even if he tried when he fought Majin Buu, he could not have defeated him. He also stated that even if he and Vegeta freed everyone who was absorbed by Buu, the two of them would not have been able to beat him. On the other hand, he did say that at as Super Saiyan 3 he could possibly have killed Kid Buu.

Also in the manga it was stated that when Fat Buu spawned Evil Buu, contrary to what the original Funimation dub said, his power was actually split between the two of them, with Evil Buu of course getting most of it. And Fat Buu actually managed to do better against Kid Buu than he did against Evil Buu.

So all this points to Kid Buu being weaker than Evil Buu, who was weaker than base Super Buu. Base Super Buu, who when he went up against Mystic Gohan, got utterly floored and would have been killed if he didn’t cheat, pull out his absorption powers, and then Gotenks stupidly got involved and got absorbed rather than letting Gohan handle things.

Hell Goku openly stated in the manga that once Gotenks split inside Super Buu, that without Gotenks’ power that Buu would not be strong enough to beat Gohan. This was despite Gohan getting weaker from the beating he took from Buu.

So in short, Gohan could have killed Super Buu, or Kid Buu, if he had actually been allowed to do it and not robbed of the chance by Buu’s plot armor.",1550996690,1550996690,TRUE,3,5,0.503759384,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,118,33,5618,0,2677,1588797939

Gameplay 
So as a 3v3 hyper fighter game like Marvel vs Capcom games, it has it's fair share of speed, bizarre and overflowing screen elements in the heat of battle which can be hard to keep track of if you're new; the gameplay speed is relatively fast compared to most other FGs and this can be daunting (it especially was for me) but within time you get used to it. Combo wise it starts off relatively simple with auto combos and the like but there is depth to it (and of course, loops). Some say the defence mechanics went from lackluster to borderline broken at the time of writing this, but at a casual level its impact is limited. Touch of Death (ToD/1 shot) combos are present, but the majority require practice and timing to pull off and use a good amount of resources and can only be realistically performed once per match making them quite risky, and therefore balanced. 1v3 comebacks happen quite frequently, and to some extent even in pro play which means they're even more of a gamble.
Graphics -
For the 1000th time, it really is just like playing/watching the anime at times and the graphics really are just THAT good, ArcSystemWorks know how to make both 2D and 2.5D graphics look stunning and easily make this the most attractive fighting game yet. 
Music - So many good soundtracks, but sadly the anime packs are rather pricey for being looped instrumental versions of many iconic songs

The best Dragonball Z game ever made, hands down. This is the game I waited 20 years for.  9.9/10

[h1]Long version:[/h1]

From the moment you start playing, it will be immediately obvious that the developers are huge fans of the show. Every voice actor is represented, both Japanese and English, and every character uniquely represents how they fight in the anime. No matter who your favorite character is, you will find yourself admitting how badass every character in DBZ is, even down to the 'weaklings'. Putting this game side-by-side with the anime, the difference is practically indistinguishable. On maximum graphics, the game is absolutely gorgeous, and runs like a dream at 60fps.

The roster is pretty much what you would expect, all of the favorites are here from the original Z-fighter gang, as well as quite a few Dragonball Super and (non-canon) DBZ movie characters. Fan favorites like Jiren and Brolly have been added in DLC, and there are rumours of even more obscure favorites like Master Roshi and Janemba. The attention to detail on the characters is staggering, down to characters trash talking each other by name, and special cinematic endings if lore-specific situations occur. [spoiler] Example: Beat Frieza with SSJ Goku on Planet Namek. [/spoiler]

The core gameplay is a 3v3 tag fighter, reminiscient of games like Marvel VS Capcom 3. Personally I did not know what to think of this going in, as I had never played a tag fighter before (other than a few hours of skullgirls), but it actually works amazing with the DBZ universe. The intensity of the battles gets downright insane at moments, and to the untrained eye, it can sometimes be hard to even tell what is happening (lots of cool explosions, teleports, etc).

The combat is extremely deep, and is a true competitive fighting game. Just look at tournament play and you will see how high the skill ceiling can be. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours you will be finding new combos, new setups, etc. This is one of the only fighting games I have genuinely had fun in training mode with, finding new combo routes and tinkering with my team synergy.

That being said, you don't need to be a pro to enjoy this game. There is a brilliant ""auto-combo"" system that lets you mash  single buttons and get (non-optimal) full combos, including a knockdown and even automatically triggering a super (if desired). With the auto-combo system you can skip memorizing and practicing combos and get straight into learning team synergy, advanced techniques, etc. Once you're ready, it is pretty easy to transition from auto-combos into real ones. I consider myself an intermediate, and I use both real and auto-combos, depending on the character/combo.

The story is a breath of fresh air compared to most other DBZ games and isn't just playing through the anime sagas in order like most other games in the past have lazily done. The story does get a bit repetitive later in the game, as it sometimes requires upwards of 20-30 fights before getting a cutscene that contains actual story. A minor complaint considering the fights are the main part of the game anyway.

There is plenty of offline and online content, and a lot of creative modes if you have friends to play with. 6-player ring fight mode is particularly crazy, with each person controlling one individual Z-fighter. Every few weeks or so there are temporary challenges, such as 3 players teaming up to beat a (very strong) AI opponent. I mainly stick to the online ranked and matchmaking, but have had fun with every single mode I've tried.

Speaking of online, the netcode is excellent, and even very bad connections are usually at least playable. I have heard others complain about it being delay-based instead of rollback, but personally I prefer delay-based netcode. As far as I know, it's the same netcode as the Guilty Gear games.

Finally, the amount of content being added and tweaked is outstanding. The developers are funding tournament leagues while also adding a new character roughly every month or two. All of the balance patches have generally been received by the community as positive, and there are only a couple characters that aren't considered tournament viable (and they aren't who you probably think they are).

Literally the only reason I cannot give this a 10/10 is the menu system. It seems Dragonball Z games will be forever cursed to have some confusing menus (and hub-based online). Changing your team loadout can be a little bit confusing at times, and customizing things like emotes is downright challenging to figure out. This is such a minor detail that I'm only taking off 0.1.

48808776,english,"If you're a Dragon Ball fan you already know the answer. If you're not comfortable with fighting games I would still recommend this game too. But this review is from the perspective of a Tekken (and Street Fighter, I can hear the booing already) player who enjoys the complexity of fighting games.

So as a Fighting game enthusiast I had picked this up because a friend of mine was interested in playing it. He said he wanted to play this because Street Fighter among other games had inputs that didn't make sense to him and were difficult to pull off in a pinch. Plus he was a fan of Dragon Ball.

He told me about this game and how it was easier to play thanks to not needing complex directional inputs and not having to spend (too much) time learning combos. I decided I'd try it and I like it a lot, but can't help but miss those Tekken/Street Fighter style inputs. However, I can still enjoy this game, and I think you might too. I'll be honest I've never had so much fun playing something I DIDN'T know how to play.

Dragon Ball FighterZ seems to be flexible enough accommodate both a competitive scene and a large casual community, so it's a great place to start loving fighting games, especially if you already love the characters themselves. The controls are simple enough, and auto combos put much less stress on needing to pull off combos and more so on opening up your opponent in the first place. Trust me, whiff punishing in this game is super easy on top of that, so this game condenses all the barrier of entry down to smart decision making.

In all honesty, I think competitive dragonball is a joke compared to tekken or even street fighter but I wouldn't blame someone for taking this game seriously and getting into the grind to get better. The community has found a number of...well, exploits that still expand the gameplay of the game into the next level and allow for professional and expressive play. It's now a part of the FGC and a very welcome part of it (after all Melee got there like the exact same way). This probably won't become your ""main game"" if you already play a more true fighting game, but it's a killer game to have at a party.

[*] The online lobbies are a step back from both BBCF [i]and[/i] DBFZ. Can't invite a friend to a room without joining the same online server first, it's dumb as hell.
[*] Combo trials are a joke. Every character gets 10 and 3 are always ""mash autocombo"" by default. Might as well not have included them.
[*] No equivalent to M.O.M. mode from GG Xrd or Grim of Abyss from BBCF. Only Story Mode, Arcade, and that's it for single player content. Even SFV has Score Attack SMH.
[*] Gameplay-wise the base game had the most bland cast of characters I've ever seen in a fighting game. Since combos were pretty much the same across the board, everything boiled down to tiers.
[*] Season Pass 1 characters were more interesting to play but frankly I still find insulting to charge people for base Goku and Vegeta.
[*] Superdash renders zoning useless in this game, might as well call the game Rushdown Simulator Z. As a result, the neutral game is boring and unengaging.

The shaders, attention to detail and the way Arc Systems strives to fight for accuracy within the smallest of movements is a masterpiece. 

The game possesses dramatic finishes, a unique cinematic rewarded to the player for completing a K.O on the final member of someones team with a specific character. My only critique is that they decide to change these finshers so that you can't skip them, as I have pulled them off only twice in about 200 hours over console and PC. 

Here is a comprehensive list of Dramatic Finishes and the stage you need to attain them: (Note, you must use a heavy or vanish attack to trigger these!!!)
Teen Gohan Vs Cell in Cell Games Arena,  SSGoku can't be on either team.
Beerus Vs Goku in Space	 .
SSGoku Vs Frieza in Planet Namek (Destroyed)
Trunks Vs Frieza in Rocky Field (Noon)
Yamcha Vs Nappa in Rocky Field (Noon)	 
Nappa Vs Yamcha in Rocky Field (Noon)	 
Goku Vs Kid Buu in Land of the Kai's	 
Beerus Vs Goku Black in Any stage! (Goku Black needs to be below 10% health to initiate a special cinematic that isn't a dramatic finish, and Black doesn't need to be the last character.)
Yamcha Vs Nappa in Rocky Field (Noon)	 
Bardock VS Frieza in Space
Frieza Vs Bardock in Space	 
Goku Vs Broly in Space	 
Adult Gohan Vs Broly in Wasteland	 
Vegito Vs Zamasu in Destroyed West City

41405019,english,"First of all, before I review this game, I want to say that if you are a Dragon Ball fan, this game is a [b]MUST HAVE[/b]!

I will make this review as arranged as possible, so I will divide it in different sections and all of them will have their [b]Pros[/b] and their [b]Cons[/b]:

[u]Gameplay[/u]

[b]Pros[/b]: The [u]Gameplay[/u] of this game (3v3 Arcade) is actually really good, including three types of combos (Light, Medium and Heavy) that can be changed with practice and make them deal more damage. Every single character has their own combos, super attacks and ultimates, these two last ones can even have variations. The graphics are good having in mind that this is an arcade game and doesn't need to have the best ones to look beautiful - it already does, and it makes you experience a real Dragon Ball fight, like in the anime!

[b]Cons[/b]: The medium combo is a good combo for starters, but it becomes stressful as it's an autocombo that can be spammed over and over in battles. When you reach become a good player and play against other good players, you can get 70% (or more) of you character's health just with a combo that started by your fault for not countering or blocking the first hit of that combo - which can be painful when you are nervous. Also, keep in mind that you will find a lot of ragequitters, which won't even get punished for it - they will just have their names in purple.

[u]Gamemodes[/u]:

[b]Pros[/b]: This game has a good amount of gamemodes, including: Story; Arcade, in which you defeat several oponents (offline) and try to get the best rank possible; Training, that is the best gamemode to practice and make better your skills; and Informal & Competitive Matches. Then there are other interactions such as the arena matches and the ring matches, that match you with people in your lobby.

[b]Cons[/b]: I can't really tell any Con for this section, you can't add much more to the actual gamemodes (maybe a Raid gamemode, but might not be as good as I think), so that's it for this section.

[u]Story[/u]:

[b]Pros[/b]: The story of this game is something new, talking about the Android 21 who is an Android and can transform into a Majin. Summarizing, the story is divided in three parts, the Good Guys one, the Bad Guys one and the Androids one, all of them with different endings and different playable characters. 

[b]Cons[/b]: It's not very well done and get boring especially in the Bad Guys part because all you do is defeat useless bots that can't even touch you... And the worst thing is that to play with Android 21 you have to complete all the three parts. I feel like this is one of the worst Dragon Ball stories in games... Really Disappointed!

[u]Characters[/u]:

[b]Pros[/b]: This game has a really extense variety of characters and colors of themselves (these last ones can be bought in the store for a good price) and like I said before each one of them has their one moves, supers and ultimate attacks. You won't get bored trying to main all of the characters and trying to make combinations for making the team that suits you well and makes you win a lot of matches! Another good thing is that new characters have been released such as Bardock, which make a even bigger character roster.

[b]Cons[/b]: The only cons that I find in this section is the fact that you have to complete all the story mode to play with Android 21 and that some characters are better than others (talking about skills).

So this was my Dragon Ball FighterZ review! Hope you liked it and that it could help you decide if you should buy this game or not, even though I'm missing some things.

As I said at the start of the review this game is a [b]MUST HAVE[/b] if you love Dragon Ball, hope you like it!

40100083,english,"[h1] UPDATED UPDATED TITLE 
NO MORE BUYERS REMORSE - I MOVED TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS FUNCTIONAL INTERNET [/h1]

Let me start off with this: I want [i] Dragon Ball FighterZ [/i] to succeed in every way, shape, and form possible; both critically for the foreseeable future and commercially going forward.

So taking this into account, my mixed feelings after 8 hours of play have left me feeling somewhat disillusioned.

Lets start off with the good before getting into some problems with [i] FighterZ [/i] which need to be addressed ASAP, and some on which I think [i] Arc Sys [/i] screwed the pooch:

[h1] The Good [/h1]

[i] Arc [/i] has created a brilliant, fluid, and sonically paced fighter with the Dragon Ball IP which we've been waiting for for a bloody long time. As much as I love games like [i] Budokai 3 [/i] on one end and [i] Xenoverse 2 [/i] (perhaps a little reluctantly) on the other, [i] FighterZ [/i] is a completely different breed of fighter. I see a great deal of reviews bashing [i] FighterZ [/i] for being far too button-mashy, subsequently calling out the [i] Budokai [/i] games as having done it better. With this I can't help but laugh; Budokai's universal combo-set and [A] (or [X] if you're on Playstation) dodge/block function practically tore through three of my controllers. 

Now this is not to say [i] Budokai [/i] wasn't a shitload of fun, but that's because it NAILED the power fanatsy of DBZ and had a relatively low barrier to entry. But we needed something a little more complex; something that could actually be taken online or to couch parties, where practice shone through and those long combos actually took some semblance of skill. A game where each character played quite distinctly and you could work your way to mastering your favourite members of the [i] Dragon Ball [/i] roster (and I'm sure there'll be more to come... hopefully...). As far s comparisons to [i] Xenoverse 2 [/i] go, this is a completey different game, but I'll admit that it doesn't quite carry the same fanfare and customizability.

[i] FighterZ [/i] is an outstandingly gorgeous game when you're in combat, though the cinematics leave a little to be desired at times. Soundtrack wise, the [i] FighterZ [/i] OST is an absolute romp and just adds to the fast-paced combat of FZ. 

However, there are a couple elephants in the room...

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

Firstly, with the exception of a few unique interactions between different party combinations, the likes of which can be hilarious at times, something about the cutscene animation in FZ is a little off-putting. But this gripe pales in comparison to the content of these cutscenes. I'll be blunt about this: [b] FZ's story mode is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. [/b] With cliches galore, it is terribly boring and provides the most lacklustre character introduction (though Android 21 is pretty rad as a character) I've experienced in a [i] Dragon Ball [/i] game. In addition to this, about 50% of the story mode is mind-numbingly boring due to the ease of your opponents, before eventually scaling up a bit, at which point it's too little too late. [b] It is repetitive and wholly uninteresting. [/b]

[b] ""BUT THE STORY ISN'T WHAT YOU PLAY FIGHTERZ FOR! ITS THAT SWEET, HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ONLINE COMBAT!"" [/b]

Time to start calling out the pachyderms... 

Firstly, [i] Arc Sys [/i] needs to fix its goddamn netcode! Playing FZ out here in South Africa without any local severs, I've been feeling this gripe that some have had pretty hard; it is nigh impossible to maintain anything of a stable connection so multiplayer is a bit of a pipedream... but there's one thing which exacerbates this further:

As I'm sure anyone who has yet to purchase FZ, doing their due dilligence before dropping that hard-earned cash, will have seen it over the last couple of days: [b] Dragon Ball FighterZ has hemorrhaged 80% of its once bragged-about playerbase! [/b]
When it comes to this wee slip-up, I think there's a perfectly reasonable explanation (in addition to the shitty netcode) for this loss in interest: [b] Dragon Ball FighterZ has abosultely nothing resembling a compelling progression system (and no, new character palettes and lobby avatars are not sufficient). [/b] Some might say that you see personal progression, mastering character combos and whatnot. In this sense, FZ is a pretty bog-standard fighting game. However, surely there needs to be something more to entice play, especially when one needs to take things offline. Hell, even new character models or outfits, new skillsets perhaps, might be sufficient. As it stands though, FZ just feels pretty tedious when you're not testing your skills in ranked matches.

Despite the scathing criticism above, I'm still giving [i] FighterZ [/i] a thumbs up. Mechanically (in combat), DBFZ is an outstanding fighter! I wish more than anything that this mass exodus had not taken place, but [b] Dragon Ball FighterZ needs more content in order to keep community interest afloat! [/b] Some might consider a game like [i] Injustice 2 [/i] a relatively bog-standard fighter, but i'm convinced that its gear system made a world of difference to the game's longevity.

Consider this review more of a warning than anything else. If things don't improve netcode and interest-wise, [i] FighterZ [/i] will be dead in the water before we know it. [i] Arc Sys [/i] and [i] Bandai Namco [/i] need to get on it! Maybe consider watching the space before dropping your cashmunies on this one if you've not yet. And though this is terribly futile, [i] Bandai, [/i] maybe consider give us an SA server?

[h1] Update [/h1]

You know what... After playing for a bit longer this afternoon, I came to the pretty obvious realisation that I can't recommend a game that I can hardly play (online).

I've gone from trying to see the virtues of this game, offering praise where it is due, to resenting my decision to pre-order this game and to give online multiplayer (without local servers) a bash again. I suppose I was trying to justify spending an absurd amount of money before doing the due dilligence I recommended above.

I'm gonna stick with [i] Xenoverse 2. [/i] It's certainly got its flaws, but at least offline is an option. It scatches that Dragon Ball itch (heh heh)... At least more than FZ has in my hours of incredibly dodgy connection, server issues, and a dead playerbase.

Poes. (lets see if Steam gets that one)

[h1] Update 2 [/h1]

48671217,english,"before I get down into the details I'm gonna give you a quick disclaimer - I absolutely love this game. after playing it baked a few times with a friend I finally picked it up for myself in may. had never played a single fighting game in my life, much less seen anything of the show. I now do both. I'll list pros and cons at length below, but the short version is this: dbfz is visually gorgeous, easy to learn (for ANYONE, not just people who play fighting games), extremely difficult to master, and endlessly entertaining.

cons first, because while the game isn't perfect it has a lot more going for it than the cons list makes it seem.

cons:
-if you're a cheapass like me, $60 plus all the dlc seems a bit steep, and the game doesn't go on sale often
-casual matchmaking tends to be much harder than competitive because people have ladder anxiety
-you ~can~ play online with a wireless connection, but it's gonna hurt. an extra $5 for an ethernet cable is highly recommended
-netplay, especially at high ranks, tends to have more than a few ragequitters who will auto-disconnect if they think they're about to lose. PROTIP, never do this. your ego may be bruised while you learn the game but if you don't go out and get bodied by better players you'll never improve
-fighting games tend to be most popular on PS4 so depending on where you live, matchmaking may not be as lively as other games depending on time of day
-story mode is pretty dull but you have to finish it to get android 21 (she's not amazing though, so don't go out of your way for it)
-you don't HAVE to buy the dlc, but a lot of dlc chars (namely bardock, vegito, arguably broly) are really good and you'll be annoyed running into them in netplay after a while if you don't know how to play them
THAT BEING SAID,

pros
-visually and stylistically, this is the best looking fighting game on the market (better than MK11 too, fight me)
-if you're a fan of the show there are tons of little nods scattered around for you to enjoy
-if you're not a fan of the show, it won't hurt your ability to enjoy the game in the slightest
-this game is really easy to pick up for a first-time FG player, the tutorials are solid and there's tons of resources (i recommend turtle hermit school) online to help
-unlike most other fighting games (MKX, SFV, etc) DBFZ is much more rewarding of aggression and doesn't force you to sit patiently and play neutral for long periods of time
-super moves look kickass, and combos are pretty easy to start learning and really rewarding to execute
-the professional scene for this game is pretty sizeable right now and IMO it'll only get bigger. for first timers, i highly recommend you watch a few pro matches now and then.
-again if you like dragon ball there's so much in here to enjoy. the attention to detail arcsys put into this game is really incredible, all the moves each character has are pulled from things they actually did on the show/movies, and ngl it's really fun to run your favorite characters
-if you're thinking about it even a little, honestly buy the game. i'll warn you that fighting games require patience and practice and if it's your first one it may take a while to develop those skills, but god damn if it isn't worth it.

I love the old DBZ games.

I love this game.

If you are into Fighting Games, want to take one seriously, and love DBZ, then stop reading this and buy this game immediately. Like right now. Leave. I am done talking to you.

If you're not all of the above then know that the game can turn off certain people. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

I recommend this game if you:
- Are a fan of DBZ
AND EITHER
- Are interested in diving into competitive fighting games
OR
- Have one or more friends to play local matches against


==============

[b]Why I wouldn't recommend this to people who are ONLY fans of DBZ[/b]

[h1]What you can enjoy as a fan of DBZ who doesn't like competitive Fighting Games[/h1]

[list]
[*]The game is absolutely stunning. Best looking DBZ game ever made. It's very. very much like watching the anime(with consistently excellent animation).

[*]Dramatic Finishes and Dramatic Entrances reenact iconic moments in DBZ before and after matches.

[*]The story mode includes unlockable special character interactions with eachother as well as the player. Seriously. There is Tiencha-grade fanservice in this game if you can find it. It's awesome.

[*]The combat is very beginner-friendly(as far as fighting games go). You can easily pull off satisfying combos and specials.

[*]If you and a friend are of equal skill level, fights will be super fun. No matter the skill level, fights of two people around the same level can be intense and satisfying. Even for two complete beginners.
[/list]


[h1]What you probably won't enjoy:[/h1]

[list]
[*]Unlocking the fantastic character interactions isn't easy, and is very boring to do. You need to start certain fights with certain characters on your team for some. For others, you need to play enough with a specific character in your team. It will feel like a grind if you're looking to see them all for yourself.

[*]The story mode is irredeemably poorly designed. The story mode will feel like a grind rather quickly if you're in it for the story.

[*]The story is relatively uninteresting. It does not retell or expand upon the story of DBZ like games of old. It tells its own story which, in my opinion, feels like an excuse to get you into fights constantly to pad the story time.
[/list]

==============

[h1]In Summary[/h1]

The single player content is not well designed. It will not be fun for long. 
If you're expecting a fun single player story driven experience like Uncharted, do not buy.
If you have friends to tag along on the ride who are interested, consider picking it up.

But the multiplayer.
The multiplayer has infinite potential just like any fighting game, but you're gonna have to have that competitive drive and willingness to grind as all fighting games require.
This is the first game that got me to actually train at a competitive fighting game.
Love it to bits.

However, I have had a problem, buying the game twice. Since it was a Play For Free installation, then Steam didn't allowed me to buy the game and accidentally, I purchased twice, but Steam refunded me because of that reason. So keep that in mind and don't blow up anything. 

If you get an error code 20006, is because EasyAntiCheat is disabled. To fix that, go to the loupe in your window task and search for Services, inside there look for Easy AntiCheat, double click and set to ""manual"". It also works with Ghost Recon Wildlands. Also, if you get an Steam API error is probably due Comodo sandboxing it. Go to Comodo icon in the task bar, unfold the menu and set Autosandbox to deactivated.

So:

BEST Fighting game in the market. The game is far away much better than the TV serie and than the other DBZ games (which I have played none). Playability is amazing but I cannot imagine why developers have not added a moving zoom camera like in Samurai Showdown, so you always have the whole picture of what's happening.

So, camera zoom is a must.
Variying the intro of each character is a must otherwise it gets repetitive, same with dialogs.
It needs more fancy super powers and shaders ""illuminating"" all the place.
Some hits deserve a final slow motion camera instead of frozen hits. I love frozen hits, and they're perfectly timed, so it gives that feeling of a super punch, but an slow motion camera in the final punch would add much more dramatism.
Also, you don't pass trhough transformations, which would been amazing.
Need more destruction, map and terrain destruction.
Also, passing through different stages is a must for the sake of violence and destruction, like in that old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting game from I don't know what console. It was very old. DBZF has something similar when you literally destroy part of a planet when finishing the adversary in the first round, but it doesn't feel like that and lacks of dynamism. However, you will experiment jawdropping.

Music is superb. Sounds are superb. Voices are superb. The game is superb but it needs more flashy movements and dramatism. I can add the octuple of dramatism and adrenaline ti this game if Bandai hires (and would give them linked ideas for free).

I in fact I wrote a whole innovatibve videogame mechanism when I was 13 years old, but I don't know where I put the drafts (now I'm 39 lol). Influenced by Sega's Weapon Lord and much later by a fighting Sega Saturn game in where you were able to transform yourself and involved wolfs or the like.

 Learning combo's is rewarding and always fun as I always get to see my favourite moves from the anime. So many teams are possible and its interesting to see how you can chain together different attacks and keep a combo going (with supports).

48342240,english,"An ode to comeptitive fighters. While certainly not the most complex and satisfying 2D fighter to learn, there is still much to see with FighterZ. Besides the gorgeous visuals, the amazing soundtrack there is still a charm to the gameplay that cannot be denied. While at its core, it is very simple with new players to the genre in mind, there is still a level of complexity within its mechanics that can take some time to truly perfect. Mixing the in-game mechanics with techniques straight from the source material, there is a really flashy time to be had. 

Having played this game extensively in most consoles, I can say I'm very satisfied with the performance on the PC. Although my personal machine isn't exactly top of the line, I still manage to get a very consistent 60 FPS on the highest settings without so much of a stutter. However, there seems to be quite a lot of issues with the online connection and I have tested with multiple options. 

Beginners can use this as their stepping stone to move on to more ""household names"" in the competitive scene, but I think that anyone willing to learn the game (even if you're a complete beginner or an experienced EVO contender) will have a hard time putting it down once they get into a couple of good fights online.

A decently sized single player, with an original story that is OK at best (Although it is robust enough and has some unique mechanics that make it stand out) As a fan of the show, I cannot say the story really impressed me and left me in awe, but it was good enough to entertain me for a few hours. The arcade mode is quite robust, with different paths and multiple difficulties. Added to this FighterZ offers some more casual approaches online, with Casual battles, Arena battles as well as Party Battles were one can enjoy some interesting matches (Such as 3 players vs 3 player matches, or super boss fights). Ranked battles allow for multiple rematches instead of the normal first to 3. But I prefer it this way to be honest.

The lobby is a cute and efficient way of bypassing the need of a text menu, so its a small plus. All other average functions for Fighting games are there, but it does lack a bigger ""Challenges"" mode that so many people enjoy. It only has a 10 mission per character system were very basic combo challenges are offered. In terms of cast selection, all the logical choices (and some surprises like Cooler and A.16) are present. Its nice to be able to use a fully fledged Yamcha or Android 16 in the game, instead of just the bigger names. However, the season pass did add some questionable choices, which makes it hard to trust the end result of Season 2.

Overall, the game lacks a few things, and it can be a tad simplistic for groups of players looking for Virtua Fighter or Tekken levels of complexity.

47917664,english,"After over 500 hours (including PC + Switch) I think it's time to review this game.

I'll premise by saying, this is the first competitive fighting game that I got serious in, mainly because of the franchise.  I love the Dragon Ball universe from its comedic beginnings, to its action-packed climaxes in Z, to its lows in GT, and even its sort-of cringeworthy parts of Super..  FighterZ offers a little bit for everyone, and there's really so much I can say about it, which is what makes it such a great game.  I found that I liked this game so much that I bought it on another platform just to practice on the go and it rekindled the love I once had for fighting games and have since played SFV, SFIV, MVCI, MKXL, Tekken 7, UNIST, and BB Cross Tag Battle, but I keep coming back to this title (maybe because it's what I'm best at, maybe because it's the franchise, but I honestly feel like it's the gameplay).  It's fast, frenetic, and so damn fun.  It looks better than the actual anime itself most times.  The netplay has drastically improved since launch.  Season 2 should be coming soon.  Hell, even the tournaments are fun to watch online.

If you like DBZ, this is the best gameplay the license has ever seen (don't buy this game for any sort of story mode or to have the ability to play 150 characters, that's where you'd want something like Xenoverse 2).

If you hate DBZ but want something kind of similar to this game, get BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle.

If you wanted MvCI to be good, get this game.

If you want to learn how to play competitive fighting games at a decent level, get this game for the fast-paced anime style.  If you want a slower game with more ""footsies"" and strategy, get Street Fighter V.

If you want a 3D fighter, Tekken 7 or SoulCalibur 6 are your best bets.",1546067465,1546067465,TRUE,134,6,0.905283451,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,340,13,44908,0,24189,1600850163

This game is mechanically uninspired and fails to deliver where Budokai 3 did not (personally, the best in the series of DBZ fighters). I play, and sure there are an assortment of combos and the like, but I can't help but feel like the game is extremely piecemealed. 

I bought the ""Ultimate"" Edition on sale for 58~$, and yet when I go in the game and play, it feels far inferior in quality delivered than a number of other fighting games. I especially hate this since I love my favorites, Bardock & Broly, but the total roster is pathetically small - compared to previous iterations.

Aside from the lack of gripping gameplay, the Game also showed many moments where I thought the FPS was off. Thought it was just me, but it happens on all footage I see. I kind of figure this was a purposeful choice, but it was just a bad decision from a visual direction standpoint.

Because this game aint complete. When you buy the game, you will have the basic (and small) roster of caracter, and you will have to pay 5€ to unlock any other caracter, one by one, or pay around 30-40€ to get the fighter pass.
So to get a complete game, you have to spend between 70€ (in discount) to a 100€ if not in sales.

47580898,english,"This is a good dragonball z game, its a terrible fighting game. 

Ill start positive and then rant about the negatives.

I love dragon ball. I grew up with it, I still watch it, i even go back and rewatch it every year. This game has a veried roster of fighters. Their are a few variations of the same fighter like ""echo fighters"" from Smash U. The stages can change visualy based on what the players do in the match such as cracking the ground, blowing stuff up in the background, switching to a different stage entirly, and even blasting the whole place into a molten hellscape. The combo system is easy to learn but extreamly hard to master. This opens the game up to a wide playerbase. you can earn titels, character color pallets, lobby skins, and fighter card decals through the ingame store with ingame money wich you earn as you play at a very decent rate. 

This game is very fun, but only in 15-20 minute sperts. The negatives greatly out-number the positives.

next to no definsive options, can't jump and block at the same time so you will be hit if you try. vanishes are supposed to be possitive on block but rarly are. character changes come in super dashing (unless you DHC) this leaves them open 100% of the time to a down heavy wich is air attack immune (super dash is conciderd an air attack) and launches into a guaranteed combo wich leads to a guaranteed snap back. the input time for normal dashes are so tight that you rarly get them with the d-pad. its much easier with the stick but the stick has such a small dead zone that useing it for blocking is nearly impossible. imputs in general are very finicky. in a single match, i don't have enough fingers to count how many inputs are droped out right. The airdashing is so wonky and broken it should just be removed or compleatly overhauled. it can turn 270 degrees to hit you on a dime. half the time when high in the air it misses entirly. they just recently changed how it interacts with vanish so the vanisher gets hit less often but still can be. The auto tracking for turning around is clucky. you dont turn around in the air half the time when you absolutly should be able too. its worse on the ground but in the opposite way. nearly instant turn arounds in combos. some characters even cut a few frames off their animations when this happens (bardock) The game is so jank mechanically that ive had entire inputs miss-read for something to happen that is a different button entirly. 

I want to love this game, I really really do but it infuriates me so much that i can't. It is the most rage enducing game that i have ever played. I rage quit matches. i havent rage quit a game in over 10 years but this game did it. This game producces 3 or 4 emotions from me and they all conflict with eachother that it sucks the fun out of the game. 

2/5 wish it was higher.",1545009013,1545009013,FALSE,2,0,0.450775683,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,87,3,14714,0,13250,1597594389

a) autocombos shouldn't even be a thing and
b) the autocombos work better than pressing random button combinations to get a combo.
Another thing, the animations are really weird. I know that the whole ArcSys style is choppy animations, but sometimes I can't tell if the game is low fps or not. If you like ArcSys' style, then, forget that argument. Everyone online is mega-asian and will whoop your ass unless you're a god. The base game is far too expensive. Even so, I'd be fine with the game being $80 CAD, if the DLCs(because yes, there are DLCs) weren't $2-15 for something that should be unlockable. Look at how many DLCs there are! 15 or so! to buy them all, it's roughly 2/3 the price of the game, I bet.

The fighting mechanics you need to play the game on a decent level are simplistic enough to allow for newcomers to ease into the more complex parts of gameplay, there's a great amount of depth in it, and it just feels so satisfying and fun to kick the crap out of your opponent with your favorite characters.
As far as a DBZ game goes, while it certainly doesn't boast a roster as definitive and mind-boggling as, say, Xenoverse 2 or Tenkaichi 3, it easily makes up for that in that the characters are all wholly unique, rather than one base character with a few different aspects to them in their 100+ different versions. The game, at base, boasts a solid 24 characters, with plenty more as DLC. There's also plenty of fanservice, with funny conversations going on between certain characters in intros/outros and certain story segments, as well as many callbacks to the series itself, some almost frame-by-frame recreations of moments from the anime.

Well over a decade of licensed fighting games have largely ranged between absolutely awful and mediocre, this game is the one that completely smashes that trend.

This game is amazing. It looks exactly like the anime, *plays* like the anime, and manages to still be a technical fighter at the same time. FighterZ puts Marvel Infinite to shame, or more accurately this game feels like a better balanced, better designed continuation of the 90s Marvel formula. The game's roster is already full sized, and features characters from every era of Dragonball Z and forward, and even fan favorites from the movies. 

I'll admit I don't know Dragonball lore that well, but you can quickly and easily get the sense that even the less appreciated characters had time and care put into them to ensure they're faithful to the source. Look up the various comparison videos for different characters on Youtube, most of the character's moves are pulled straight from either the show or the movies and reproduced almost frame by frame with careful attention to detail.

47185240,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ, the revolutionary anime fighter that finally showed the world what a GOOD fighting game based on a popular show could really achieve. But is it still worth your time and money? Let's delve into it a bit.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
FighterZ, due to its rather large nature, has too many positives to list. Instead I will cover what I believe are the most beneficial positives as reasons to get the game.

[b][u]Fantastic Art Style[/u][/b]
The art style of FighterZ is something to behold. With absolutely beautiful cell shading, gigantic explosions and beams that do the show justice, the entire game almost looks like the manga / anime came alive onto your screen. The art, paired with the near flawlessly smooth animations, do the fights of the source material justice, unlike many previous titles that despite however good they may have been, were just ""good for an anime game"" at best. The fact they looked like marionettes dancing around didn't help.

[b][u]Picture-Perfect Replication of the Source Material[/u][/b]
This is a more subtle strength of the game, but I think it's worthy of mention. ArcSystem clearly watched the ENTIRE show and all the movies just to make this game. With very few exceptions, almost every single move in the game is a direct copy of a move in the show that character used. (Obviously not including characters that never actually fought seriously in the originals, such as Android 18) This even extends to basic moves, such as Broly's down-heavy and ki blasts, Kid Buu's underground stomp mediums, etc etc. The incredibly and frankly insane level of replication is worthy of immense praise. The fact that nearly none of the normal moves or Supers were made up without using the source material is incredible.

[b][u]Easy to Learn, Hard to Master[/u][/b]
Unlike a lot of fighting games, in which every individual character has their own specific circle turns required, button inputs, yadda yadda, FighterZ uses a very basic system. Every Super and basic premade combos are universal inputs, and many special attacks share inputs as well. This system encourages players to experiment with as many characters as they want, instead of being the one dude who looked at all the full-circle inputs for Hugo on Street Fighter, looked down at his Xbox controller D-Pad, and immediately gave up. However, the mechanics in FighterZ are also much deeper than they appear. The combo potential for every character, including jump canceling, reflecting at the right time, proper reflect baiting, etc, gives so much room for improvement.

[b][u]References Everywhere[/u][/b]
The absolute BEST praiseworthy aspect of FighterZ is the love letter it has written to long time fans of the material. FighterZ is absolutely OVERFLOWING with references, heartwarming interactions between old friends, and if you take the time to really crack open Story Mode, humorous and fascinating opinions the characters have on certain outlooks. Nearly every single time a character opens their mouth, it takes you right back to the show / manga you originally fell in love with.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
While FighterZ may be a fantastic anime game, it has no shortage of glaring problems as well for prospective players. The ones Ive listed below are the most problematic of the bunch and are things I believe prospective buyers should be aware of before purchasing.

[b][u]Story Mode and Arcade are Kinda Sh*t[/u][/b]
The major problem with the game is the lack of any decent content outside of online play. Story Mode alternates between pathetically easy at lower levels, with AI basically never even moving, to absolute omnipotent gods at high levels that can punish a 6 frame jab with a Level 3 80% of the time. Arcade is much of the same, except enemies enjoy a hefty damage increase of around 40% max, meaning that even the most basic of combos will still cripple all your characters. Its the same trashy single-player fighting game design we've all come to know and hate.

[b][u]Skilled Opponents Won't Let You Play[/u][/b]
As I previously mentioned, FighterZ has a wealth of deep mechanics to master for dedicated fighting game players. However, for anyone looking for a casual option, this game is no better than any other fighting games. A skilled opponent will have an answer to EVERY single thing you throw at them, and will usually counter you with ease before performing their maximum damage perfectly optimized corner combo loop to keep you in unbreakable hitstun for over 30 seconds. And you can't even defend against them, because they also have an answer to all your blocking techniques and can perfectly crack you open so fast you don't even properly learn what went wrong. Like all fighting games, this is a huge, glaring problem that is NEVER fixed properly due to generally inaccurate matchmaking skill levels. It will take you hours to ever stand a chance in online play.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
FighterZ is, despite the pretty exterior, a fighting game through and through. Any previous fan of the Dragon Ball franchise will get great satisfaction at all the jokes and references intended for them, but will find their dedication severely tested if you attempt to get deeper into the game mechanics. Be prepared to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours grinding away to even rival the players you meet online, let alone defeat them. Story Mode and Arcade are functional, but have their own clear flaws after a while of playing. 

I would recommend this only for people who are great fans of the franchise and can tolerate the mediocre story combat for the character interactions, or people looking for a very good fighting game they don't mind sinking months into. If you don't fit either of those descriptions, FighterZ may be a risky purchase for you.",1543493055,1543714973,TRUE,78,6,0.869253695,8,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,195,26,5182,0,5182,1544088048

I did enjoy fighting games before getting into this game, but not quite to the same extent as I do now. 301 hours later, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game was worth every cent for me. There's also plenty of complaints about the DLC characters being an extra 5$. Personally, each character is unique enough that, I don't particularly mind at all. Most of the enjoyment and longevity of this game comes from the mechanics themselves, and playing online. Currently I've played about 2000 ranked matches, and I'm fairly high ranked, along with an unknown number of casual matches. I have a single DLC character on my team. Meaning to get the enjoyment that I have right now, I'd only need to pay an extra 5$. That being said, I have purchased each character, because I feel like each character is worth the 5$ and adds something unique to the game. I jump around the roster quite a bit in casual, so its fun to mix it up everynow and then and try out new teams, but that in no way means you *have* to buy the DLC characters to get the full enjoyment out of this game. Most of my favorite characters in the game come with the base game. The only character anybody would feel pressured into buying right now, would probably be Bardock, as he's currently considered one of the best in the game. But I can say with first hand experience that you do not need high tier characters to do well in the online mode in this game. That, added with the fact that Bardock is the only DLC character considered high tier, makes me believe that there is no real reason to purchasing the DLC beyond just simply thinking it to be worth it.

Pros
-graphics and animation is amazing
-it is very smooth playing
-in online matches you both recieve the same connection so that means you are not on 100 ping while the other is only at 5 so it is equal leveling
cons

47084176,english,"Finally, a proper fighting game based on a popular IP. Developer Arc System Works took their years of experience with the Guilty Gear franchise, and their newest effort mixes elements of their previous works, tag team mechanics borrowed from other classic tag fighters such as Marvel vs Capcom, along with stuff exclusive to this game and the Dragon Ball series (the summoning of Shenron by collecting all 7 Dragon Balls, for instance).

The game is a true love letter to fans of Dragon Ball, with animations, quotes, voices and super moves straight from the anime. ArcSys obviously knows how hard most fighting games are to learn, and made DBFZ really easy to pick up and play for basically anyone. The hardest motion in the entire game is the quarter-circle-forward (236), AKA the first motion learned for most other FG players. The combo system is very forgiving, and even if you don't want to learn your own combos you can always use the auto-combos that every character has. The roster, while not enormous by any means, is very well balanced, if you want to play your favorite character, go right ahead, it's much more important to build a good team around him.

The game isn't perfect though; the story mode is way too easy and extremely boring, the roster is dominated my male characters (only 2 females at the time this review is posted IIRC), last enemies in the arcade mode straight up cheat by dealing like 5x damage to you, and most importantly there are less than 2k daily active players, so the few online matches you do find might be against much more experienced opponents who will absolutely crush those just trying to learn the game.

Nevertheless, I still really enjoy this game, and the beautiful graphics, the gameplay that manages to be fun and easy while having a high skill ceiling, the great soundtrack, and the sheer fun of combo challenge mode keeps me coming back. I recommend buying on sale/free weekend/big update, as the lack of a large playerbase will hurt your experience otherwise.

47080314,english,"   First, this game isn't as difficult to pick up as some people might think. Traditionally, arcade-fighter style games have had difficult to master, arcane controls that have made it difficult for new, fresh players to enter the genre. This is not the case with FighterZ. Controls are easy to learn, while not being so simple as to make the game boring.

   Next, the content. Almost goes without saying that this game is a must-buy for Dragon Ball fans. The visuals are almost magical; Arcsys somehow managed to make this game look like it popped straight out of the anime. The music is good and makes a nice fusion of Dragon Ball aesthetic and arcade fighter sound.

   Fights are fluid and make sense in context. Each character has lines of dialogue specific to who they are fighting against and who they are fighting with. Story mode is full of short and funny one-off conversations between characters that would make any DB fan laugh. The plot itself doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but eehhh, who cares.

On top of that enough care and thought was put into that if you're a DBZ fan you'll gush over all the little things and character interactions but not totally reaching fan service levels that make it unbareable to someone who has never seen DB  before.

Some people may think that the dlc characters are a put off but with 24 character free in the base game I don't see a problem with the dlc standards. You have a strong full roster when you buy the game so it doesn't feel incomplete at all. The dlc characters would never have made it into the game without the games as a service model and it doesn't feel lacking in content without them so it's perfectly fine to have it.

-The online is actually full of bugs.

To start off, despite having a few fighting games between all my systems, I've never really be that great at them. I just don't have much of a patience for sitting down to learn the combos, and end up being terrible because it. But with this game, it was never a problem for me. I don't know why, maybe it's because it's Dragon Ball, and I grew up with most of the cast, and love Team Four Star. It just clicked with me.

That being said, this game is easily 10/10. It has very solid 3v3 fighting game mechanics similar to, but not as broken as, UMvC3. The game is extremely easy to pick up, and is very newbie friendly. I don't think I'd ever be able to climb as high as I have in any other fighting game. This game is the perfect balance between ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" and ""esports level plays."" It's fast paced, Dragon Ball action, with the perfect look for a Dragon Ball game. While it isn't quite a 100% recreation of the Dragon Ball fights in the anime, it is still the most fun I've had in both a fighting game, and in a Dragon Ball game. Nothing has topped this to this date, and I this game is a solid addition to any fighting game collection anyone could have, and probably won't disapear until a sequal comes out.",1517232615,1543250023,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,214,8,11517,0,8254,1590455029

I picked up this game simply because of the DB name, not sure what to expect going into it. I played games like Budokai when I was younger, but the only ""competitive"" fighting game I played consistently was Melee. I've played bits and pieces of games like MK9 and SFV, but never really been into fighting games. However, DBFZ changed that for me.

The game is fan service to a T. Cinematics before/after fights that reference DB, 99% of the moves having source material from the series, character interactions, this game has it all. Even sound effects and visuals are a fantastic representation of the series, 

As a fighting game itself I cannot give much review, but I can say the game even inspired me to pick up a fight stick and look up combos, unlike any other fighting game has done before.

I personally give the game a 9/10, and the only reason it doesn't have a solid 10 is because the single player mode is repetative and lacking, but as a multiplayer fighter, it is phenomenal.",1543202345,1543202345,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,255,6,8241,21,6995,1601935076

46858246,english,"This is a fine game. No, it's actually a very good game. The reasons why I don't reccomend it have to do exclusively with my own background and experiencie. This, most likely, won't apply to you, but in the offchance it does, hear me out.

I've been a major sucker for Arc System fighters for along time, ever since I first played Guilty Gear. I just love not only the fast-paced 2D combat, but, more than that, the concepts behind the fights. Completely insane, off the wall characters with absolutely weird designs, weapons and ludicrous attacks. This is what I love most about Arc System fighters: their uniqueness.

Sadly, though, there's nothing unique about Dragon Ball, not anymore at least. This is not a jab at Dragon Ball, which is a perfectly fine franchise. The thing is, I've seen it all over the span of 20 years and it's become extremely familiar. Even with an Arc System coat of paint. It's still the same old kind of fighting we've been experiencieng for a while now, and it just didn't grab me.

The game felt a little too simple compared to, say, GGXRD, where every character has its own set of moves and they all feel quite distintc. Here, most characters used the same combinations to perform similar moves. Yamcha might throw some punches, Goku might do some kicks and... that's about it. Again: completely competente, but insufficient if you're looking for something more.

Overall, the game looks great, sounds great and plays great. It doesn't, however, surprise, not in the mechanichs nor in the presentation, and that's what in the end killed it for me.  If you're a fan of Arc System Works, this might not be enough for you.

FighterZ is simultaneously easy to jump into, even if you've never played a fighting game before, and has enough depth to satisfy more dedicated fighting-game fans. Take for example that different characters use the same button inputs to do radically different moves.

Story mode is a filler arc that takes place either before or after the Goku Black arc. While the plot isn't anything special, the real enjoyment comes from the cheeky interactions between the characters. Take for example Cell chatting with Adult Gohan or Gotenks trying to help Nappa go Super Saiyan. You can tell that the developers were big Dragonball fans.

Online is where most of the action is, the netcode is a peer to peer I think, not roolback, but it's mostly good connection quality after 1400 games or so I can say it's playable, and you're likely to someone with a decent connection you end up playing a first to 10 in, Online is solid, the game has other online but I have not played them yet,
    Characters, mostly everyone is here and. There are a few repeats of Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan but they're arguably unique enough from eachother and play diffenent enough for that character slot. 
Sound are great, there is JP and EN VO and the soundtrack is great fit for the action on screen
Overall this is a great game to play casually with friends or to test your mettle online there is a Dragon Ball FighterZ World Tour, like Capcom pro tour and each event is a great watch. This game has great polish and is a no brainer if you're a fan.
though a hardcore fighing game enthusiast might have some complaints with some mechanics and we all should, even I do, fix auto correcting auto combo's, nerf super dash, nerf vanish, buff zooning playstyles game is very offensve rush down base and besides that as a fighting game this could be one of the best no joke!!!!!",1542999405,1542999405,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,79,2,47656,0,20125,1600377179

As a fan of the Dragon Ball series I committed the worst sin amongst gamers and pre-ordered the game, I had played XV, XV2 and a couple other DB games before and I had never been let down by a DB game, so I took the risk. I’ve been playing for about 13 hours and I have to say that I’m very impressed.

The netcode is fine, I set up my controller with no issues and the lobby system isn’t as bad as people are making it out to be so don’t be put off by what some people are saying. I will say that it takes me quite a while to find an online ranked match, but I’ve already played about 12 so I wouldn’t say it’s so bad that it’s a put off. The story mode can get a bit tedious when you get to the 100th clone but again that isn’t too much of a complaint.

The storyline, artwork and gameplay put this game up at god tier for me and I’m not even a huge fan of fighting games, it’s been executed very well. I would say that fans of Dragon Ball will enjoy this one, fans of fighting games will enjoy this one and even people who are neither may enjoy this one. I can honestly see myself playing this for another 100+ hours and I’ve only got two games up to that amount (Didn't quite make it to 100+ hours but I do find myself revisiting the game time and time again).

If there is one thing to criticize it would be the tedious story mode. the interactions between the characters are great but not enough to save the mode. it gets repetitive fast. And in a lesser note, the clunky lobby interface.

Dragon Ball FighterZ is a breath of fresh air for tag-team fightings AND for Dragon Ball games. It is fun, it looks great and the interaction between characters is a nice bonus. Arc System Works put a lot of effort into everything in this game (though Story Mode looks a lame tbh). Especially when it comes to the representation of the Dragon Ball universe. ASW really cared about it during the development process and this is great.
The fighting side is also good. Newbies can catch up with autocombos while adepts can start by rolling right into the flashy tag super combos (by the way, in order to do this just press the assist button during your 1 bar super if you want to both switch the character and deal some more damage. If you're going for max damage press back+assist button after the 1 bar super to instantly perform next character's 3 bar super). 
Balance is another thing, so let's discuss some characters right now:
1) Android 16 or Michael Jordan - one of the most powerful characters for now. Watch out for grabs and armor (which doesn't work againist supers and projectiles). Also remember that if he touches you once you might stop moving forever.
2) Cell or Mr. Perfect Cell - pretty terrifying opponent due to his mix up options and speed but can be outpressured. Espesially dangerous with Kid Buu in one team.
3) Kid Buu or JUST STOP EXISTING YOU LITTLE **** - 2nd most dangerous character in the game. He can literally catch you from the other side of the screen and go for the full combo. However he hates being under pressure where he is extremely defenseless.
4) Adult Gohan or HOW IS THIS POSITIVE ON BLOCK?! - 1st most dangerous character for now. I really don't know how to handle him due to his level up system, this requires further investigation.
5) Bardock or The Rushdown King - he might look overpowered but he is completely defenseless under the pressure. In other words, The Rushdown King can't deal with The Rushdown.
6) Captain Ginyu or TOKUSENTAI, TOKUSENTAI TOOOOKUSENTAI! - the strongest AND the hardest character in the whole game. And his theme is cool.

P.S. Still waiting for Ultra Instinct Monaka

When I play FighterZ I feel like I’m playing a game that was designed with me, as the fan, in mind. Not just money and “how can we cram as much content as possible into this”. FighterZ is more like “what is the most unnecessary little detail we can put in that the fans will love because we love dragon ball too.” It’s a wholesome experience especially coming out xenoverse.﻿ It may not be absolutely perfect but its still pretty damn good. and for a dragon ball game this is as good as it gets. On the topic of the prices. I'd rather pay 100 dollars on a game I know is going to be good and Im going to play for hundreds of hours than save a little money on one thats subpar with shitty buissness practices. I want to encourage well developed games rather than shitty ones even if it means paying a lot of money because I feel like im getting my money's worth. 


  I highly reccomend. the controls may be a bit scary at first but its not as bad once you play the game for a little while.

The theme, if you have or do enjoy the Dragon Ball universe, is just a perfect match for a fighting game and so I think a fightning game of this quality was very long overdue.

The game is easy to learn and very hard to master.

The complaints I have are as follow:
- The campaign solo is a joke, don't do it unless you are VERY bad at the game or you want all the achievements.
- The lobby where you physically move between game modes is a little annoying and not a necessity for such a game.
- Combos can be very lenghty at higher levels so much that if the opponent hit you and confirm, it's time to sip that cofee or beer.

- While the story line is a bit confusing, as it is released in chunks that do not contain all of the information, the story becomes worthwhile by the last chapter. 
- Each character offeres a reasonably unique set of moves and a definitie difference in feeling when fighting. There are obviously phsyical fighters (e.g. Nappa), harrassment fighters (e.g. Ginyu), specialist fighters (e.g. Android 21), etc. They all feel smooth and use the same moveset to open the game up to those who have mastered the fighting genre and to those who might be playing for the first time.
- The graphics and animation are a stunning reinvigoration of the tire cell shaded games by utilizing true to series, yet highly stylized animation.
- For the fighting fan, there is an unlimited amount to do after the story has ended: arcade modes, local matches, world matches... You'll find yourself losing yourself to this game eventually.

Pros- Easy to learn Hard to master

         Beginner friendly 

         The best Graphics and fighting mechanics of any dragon ball game, ever!

         The character interactions in story mode

Cons- Story mode is kind of ehh, cant even play as some of the characters, and its very repetative. (can still be enjoyable for fans and at least its not another retreading of the original plot like nearly all other anime games) 

           Internet matches should be better, (not terrible, but there is a noticeable drop in just overall enjoyment compared to playing locally)

            AI will very noticibly cheat by doing laughably more damage, inciting much rage

46088082,english,"So i may or may not have the most experience in the game, but through playing most of the other Bandai Namco Dragon Ball games like Xenoverse, Budokai etc i feel like FighterZ is slightly detatched from the other games, it feels more like Tekken with Dragon Ball characters, not like thats a bad thing, infact i think its a cool change. In terms of graphics the game is definately game of the year material, one of the superior fighting games this year graphically. The mechanics in FighterZ are very expansive, with the combos having very interesting chains and air-combos that you can do which were more restricted in the previous games. I think the biggest issue with FighterZ is it's networks and server problems with the infamous 'disconnected from lobby' message every couple minutes when playing, this is a prominent theme in many of Bandai Namco's fighting games, but not at as bad of a scale of FighterZ. Another large issue i'd like to touch upon is the story mode, it feels lack-lustre at best with having almost no relation to Dragon Ball entirely, feeling like a lazy filler for a singleplayer mode instead of actually taking the singleplayer as an important component of the game. In comparison to Xenoverse the story is very lame in fairness, with not toxicity at all, im a huge fan of the anime and manga, watching all of the episodes and reading all of the seasons word for word, i take the story very seriously in Dragon Ball games, it feels like something that is essential in a game based around something as complex as the Dragon Ball universe. The game does feel like it is being updated, but not nearly as frequently as i should be, i think more frequent and larger changes would be very beneficial for the health of the game. 

In conclusion, i think DBFZ is a fantastic fighting game for Dragon Ball anime/manga fans, the experience is very gripping and exciting, the combat is intense, the graphics are stunning and the characters each feel like they have their own personalities, rightfully so. The game has it's problems, with atrocious net code, very unreliable online servers and a lack-lustre story. The game is great, and definately deserves a place for respect.",1542844577,1542844577,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,46,6,2503,0,1193,1591900202
46087455,english,"+Good fighting game fundamentals. It's very rushdown oriented with few characters who are true zoners (that sounds ridiculous when most of the cast has full screen laser blasts, but trust me on this one). My only gripe is that there aren't enough defensive options for my tastes.
+Will scratch DAT MAHVEL itch for team-based combat.
+Easy to pick up and play for even casual players while still having considerable depth.
+Stunning visuals. They really nailed the art style of the series with this one.
+Decent music, complimented by the original voice actors and excellent sounds.
+A varied (playstyle) cast that has a little bit for everyone.

-Get used to seeing Bardock every game. He's not unbeatable, but he has easy oven bake pressure that you can exert almost full screen while still being super safe.

46014813,english,"A labor of love create by ArcSystemWorks and possibly the first truly competitive dragon ball game out there. You can tell based on how every move is recreated from the series and manga itself. From the 5L to the cinematic finishes, the beautiful cel shading, and excellent sound design.

The single player consists of you roaming around fighting as a character that's stuck in random character's bodies which gives them back their powers. That's the excuse they came up with to explain Krillin being able to attack Cell. It feels like a slog with the endless waves of enemies. You do get to see interactions between characters like Gotenks and Ginyu having a contest to see who can make the superior pose. Beyond those interactions, I don't see people enjoying it too much.

The multiplayer is an unwelcome departure from previous ArcSys games with a lack of invites to ""lobbies."" You're forced to go to a server, pick where you would like to go, create a ring match, enter a passcode, relay this passcode to friends, then have them come to the same server to join. It is one of the most poor decisions I have seen for a fighter regarding private ""lobbies."" The netcode still uses ArcSys' delay-based netcode which is a severe disappointment because that limits the number of people you can fight under playable conditions.

However, despite me just destroying this game, it is still a very good game. I wanted to get the negatives out of the way immediately. Now I'll try to convince you despite these glaring flaws it's a good game.

The music in this game is superb and your typical ArcSys soundtrack. You're not missing anything without the anime BGM pack. It consists of a lot of rock music, not anime if you're concerned about that. Check out themes like Goku Black, Ginyu, West City, Last Battle (21), and more on youtube.

The attention to detail in this game is something I immediately gushed about, but there are still things like when you reflect a fireball it goes into the background and destroys a piece of the stage. Doing a smash attack can also send your opponent flying and you transition to another stage. The battle damage you take is visible on the victory screen and depending on your team there will be little easter eggs like krillin joining 18 for her level 3 super instead of 17.

Now the most important part of any fighter... the gameplay. When you first pick it up and play, you'll find it to be very simple. You have two standard auto-combos, they auto-correct, and track the enemy. You might find this to be annoying at first, but some serve a genuine purpose. There is an annoying one or two, but you'll learn as you play that these are very useful at times. They can help you track your opponent in the air and keep momentum for certain combos. Don't sleep on them, especially on some reflect happy enemies. Give them a big ole' hug for mashing on that reflect.

Okay, now that I've addressed that concern, let's continue. You have your basic smash attacks that send the opponent flying, you can use super dash once in the air for follow-ups, some characters have command normals to compliment their moveset, you have a vanish you can use to wallbounce for confirms or combo extensions, etc. You have more freedom with assists than you usually would in other tag fighters like calling both at once or during unsafe moves. You have a plethora of tech options including a delayed wake-up. The only time you don't is after you get hit with a level 3 super barring a few exceptions. Reflect acts as the game's push block, so you will get rushed the hell down. You need to find the gaps in their block strings and punish appropriately or reset neutral. Dragon Rush is this game's version of a throw. You can tech it by inputting it, but you can also tech it by pressing an attack button for a shorter tech window at varying times.

Those are just some of the gameplay basics, what's really important is team synergy. Things like ""will this character help my neutral? what combo extensions can I get off of this? does his super allow me to double super?"" and other various stuff. The balance of the game is good even if there are some characters that are clearly better than others. It's the typical ""this character does what this character does, but better."" Maybe the other character is better suited for your team? Maybe they fit your play style more?

With all that said, remember the basics. 2H the shit out of every super dash, snap their ass out to take that blue life, and reflecting vanish in the corner is a free punish. I would say more, but Steam has a character limit for reviews.

The 2D-3D art direction works perfectly and is incredibly reminiscent to real DBZ, the map destruction and explosion effects from every impact are so satisfying, and the cinematics beautifully illustrate the most iconic and loved moments of DBZ which every fan will appreciate, as well as the many fan-service filled quotes and hidden content deep within the game.

- Clunky lobby.
- Cannot browse through available matches or people easily. I wish I just had a list of matches or a quick matchmaking button without navigating in this lame 3D interface.
- I also wish I could select my 3 characters easily online before every match or chose from a preset rather than manipulate presets in a very inconvenient menu (why would you develop 2 character selection screens !!).
- I wish I just had interactive buttons that I could navigate through on the screen rather than learning again how to do something in every sub menu in which controller buttons always do something different.

Unlockables:
- Stupidly slow to get.
- Based on random.
- Besides colors of the characters in game, most feel completely useless (stickers, titles, lobby avatars & colors... these do not feel like a reward at all).
- Frustrating coin system: spend coins, most of the times you get another kind of coins instead, then eventually get something you don't even want.

Value for money:
- Felt ripped off by the ""ultimate edition"" which uses ""songs"" (literally with a singer) as combat soundtrack while totally not appropriate for the fighting ambiance. The genuine soundtrack that was implemented does not fit well as you can have nice fighting music which suddenly changes for something peaceful or very cheerful in the middle or the fight. There was a a free mod at some point that made a far better job. Commenter's voice is also useless.
- DLC character price is very high.

Playing with friends:
- Finding your friends online is insanely complicated, as you have to sync to know in which lobby they are. I could not find any option to simply invite or join them.
- Simplest way to do so is do a quick phone call and sync and let him know on which lobby you are and under which umbrella your character is hiding.
- 64-person-limited-lobby and random connection to any one of them to make sure finding your friends is not too easy.
- Impossibility to play with someone outside of current lobby.

Online issues:
- Frequent lag.
- Now struggling to play online with a friend as we have the ""EAC disconnect: peer untrusted"" error while we both have the basic version of the game without mods. We can both play online on our own with other players though. Does not make sense.


=> Now some positive stuff: the fighting part is very good but the devs made a mess out of everything around it. Please just make something simple that works and stay focused on the essential.",1541456435,1541461506,FALSE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,255,4,20911,0,7656,1592669559
45646544,english,"[h1]Dragon Ball FighterZ is a (beautiful looking) mess of a game[/h1]
I don't even know where to begin with this thing. It basically does 2 things right: graphics and fanservice, while failing at everythig else.
The implementation of the Guilty Gear Xrd engine gives this game a gorgeous faux 2D style that's honestly hard to improve on, to say the least. It's colorful, clean and really gives the illusion of 2D animation thanks to a carefully animated moves following the principles of 2D animation, which most games 3D games don't do anymore.
As for the fanservice, Arc System Works really did their homework for this. The game is filled with canonical moves extracted from the manga down to very basic melee moves. Furthermore, unique intros and dramatic finishes put the cherry on top with really cool moments and recreations of the anime that are rare enough to keep feeling special through time.
However, that's where the good news end. Everything else, from the very first minute of gameplay up to the long term experience offers diverse degrees of awful. 
For starters, the game uses a system of [b]online lobbies[/b] as a substitute for both online rooms and the main menu. This would be perfectly fine if it wasn't for the fact that it replaces both the menu and the player made lobbies, which generates a few issues. For starters, entering the ""main menu"" in online mode will get you an appalling 11 popups and 4 loading screens between the start screen and the ""main menu"". Then, you are left in a lobby with up to 63 other people in which you can access the different modes and several online play options. Between these online play options, 3 of them use automated matchmaking, which sometimes can be underwhelming; and Ring Match, a replacement for the ""player room"" feature. This Ring Match system is the biggest issue of this lobby system. In the first place, it will only be accessible for people within the same lobby; giving it way less exposition than a regular player made room and thus making it harder for random people to join and a nuisance for friends to join. But worse than that, Ring Matches can be joined by up to 7 other players, but only 4 can be playing at a time, which is a huge downgrade from the Xrd rooms and quite nonsensical.
For the [b]single player[/b] enthusiasts that may be looking for a nice Dragon Ball experience here, it's not their lucky day either. The game offers 2 single player modes: an unorthodox arcade mode with poorly implemented incremental difficulty, and story mode. The story is a completely new arc unique to the game starring Android 21, an original character made for this game, and it's told from 3 points of view (the good, the bad and 21). The story is weak even for battle shounen standards, and the fighting is so incredibly easy that the entire thing feels like a chore, specially taking into account that it is mandatory to finish the story in order to be able to play as A21.
And to end with game modes: [b]the tutorial[/b]. It's a decent tutorial, but also tricky. It does explain every mechanic to you, but somehow some mechanics are only explain in the pause menu, such as tagging in with a super without doing your active character's super first. It could be better, but it could also be a lot worse (I'm looking at you, Tekken).
Now, how about the most important piece of the puzzle: [b]gameplay[/b]. Dragon Ball FighterZ is a lot like SFV in that it tries too hard to please casual players that lack experience with the game, ruining the entire thing and also somewhat similar to Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm, hilariously enough.
There are 2 halves I want to comment about here: universal mechanics and character mechanics. The [b]universal mechanics[/b] (or those that are available to every character) are not only bad but also makes the character mechanics situation worse than it could be. For starters, the ""super dash"" (meant to be a button for casual players to skip the neutral game as, and I quote, ""Casual players don't enjoy the neutral game as much as the experienced players do""), a mechanic really similar to Naruto's chakra dash,  is probably the most awful mechanic I have ever seen put into a fighting game. Just like in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series; it gets a combo on hit, relatively safe on block, tracks the opponent extremelly well, goes through some projectiles and will be a key element in why the neutral in this game is so awful.
Alongside that, we have a safe on block teleport with the cost of an EX move which can cancel other moves even on whiff. Not a great mechanic, yet not the worst we have here.
To understand why the neutral game is so awful, I must explain a few things before getting into assists. First, projectiles can be ""light"" and ""heavy"", based on whether or not they can stop a super dash or nullify another heavy projectile (again, much like the ones in UNS). The heavy projectiles include the famous ""kamehameha"", which virtually limitless horizontal range and relatively low startup and similar techniques which will be addressed here as ""beams"". And second, the crouching heavy attack is completely invulnerable to airbourne attacks.
Now, assists let you call one of your inactive characters to throw a predefined move. Some of which are beams. Being an inactive character performing the move, you character is completely free to move. All of this creates a huge problem when it comes to the neutral game. The combination of the super dash and the beams, both of them able to cross the entire screen, makes careful spacing non-existent; as the beams hit the entire screen at once and will end the neutral as soon as they hit, thanks to the ability of your character to take the leading hand while the assist does its thing. Thus, an optimal play usually consists in almost immediately ending the neutral with an assist. Furthermore, the trinity made by the superdash, the beams and the crouching heavy generates a rock-paper-scissors kind of scenario in which those 3 options define the neutral game in the absence of assists, working from full screen without really taking space into account.  To make it worse, regular (non-assist) beams can also be cancelled into a teleport to get the leading hand.
That sums up how [b]the universal mechanics work together to remove the neutral game, which is the most important part of any fighting game[/b].
Now, Arc System Works' games have always had really odd, interesting and creative [b]character mechanics[/b] that made it feel that each character was its own little game. That is not the case here. Most of the cast has a really redundant set of tools and lack any kind of unique traits. There are some that do have their own unique mechanics, yet here another problem arises, and that's that most of them don't really get a chance to exploit them in a meaningful way, and their mechanics, if anything, are limited to be used in combos, as the neutral is dominated by a handful of universal mechanics.
The greatest example for this is Beerus, the character with the greatest (lost) potential in the game. In short, he can set projectiles with which he can interact, hitting them to move them around somewhat like Guilty Gear's Venom. However, these projectiles are light projectiles with low damage that will go awaywhen you get touched. Both on hit and block (but not reflect). As light projectlies, they get mercilessly destroyed by beams and flought through by the superdash. Furthermore, they only last 5 seconds, regardless of whether or not you set additional projectiles (unlike Venom). This makes it extremelly hard for a Beerus to actually develop a dangerous zoning game as it is really hard to keep a high amount of projectiles in the screen and each projectile does little damage. Just like him, characters like Krillin can't really get the most out of their unique mechanics. Rendering them redundant.
The lack of defensive mechanics is also a problem, but Steam won't let me write more.

Some people get kicked from matches or online lobbies, while I can't even connect to a lobby within my selected region. I can't even load the player data I created for online play because of a network error. Even at 60% off, this failure to connect online for about an hour, prompted me to issue a refund request, which was granted to my surprise. 

I was a huge fan of the Budokai games growing up, and I've always wanted to test my skills against other players within a 2-D dragon ball universe, but I can't - and many others can't either. 

The game looks beautiful though and the animations are crisp - they're amazing to watch. But it seems that reviewers around the Internet are letting online play issues slip through their thinly vailed glasses - favoring eye candy over playability and performance. We are talking about a fighting game after all. If players from around the world can't connect to fight one another, then how can this entry in the Dragon Ball series of video games, ever be taken seriously as a fighter?

Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't so much a fighting game as much as it's a game that struggles to deliver on that promise in the first place.

Ever since the weeklong network issues from late August got ''fixed'' (which you could fix yourself by first launching Fornite during that time... for whatever reason) the netcode has remained incredibly unstable for me. 
This has lead to multiple random lobby disconnects, the infamous ''EAC Peer Untrusted'' errors and various network errors. I think i've seen them all at this point.

Everytime I start this game it's a gamble of how good the game will run because these issues don't always occur. 
Restarting the game, steam or my PC helped for a while I believed, until I figured it is just random.

I enjoyed my time in this game, reaching triple digits in playtime. The netcode at launch was bad but it got better and for a long while it was very stable. I genuinely enjoy the gameplay and in between the network errors im having a very good time with the gameplay. (although the lobby system leaves ALOT to be desired)

But ever since the netcode/servers/whatever broke late August, the netcode just hasn't been the same for me.
As such I can't recommend this game to anyone newly interested unless its on a deep sale.

30 hour Edit:
The only consistancy in the game i've found is that the AI on Hard Arcade doesn't have an air combo or normal combo damage regression. Kid Buu just comboed me from 90% full health to 0 in one Ultimate Move combo which at the end was 130 hits. The AI Shouldn't have a drastic damage advantage over the player. The only reason this game has high reviews is due to the game being flashy. I love all things DBZ but I'd rather play Famicom DBZ games. Broken AI =/= Challenge.

It goes against Everything DBZ that you can't break a combo, especially ones so high. After reading and then performing how to Infinite people in corners with specific characters, I can't help but lack the understanding of why the developer hasn't patched these out or introduced the ability to break combos, at the very least with support characters. This is the first time i've ever regretting purchasing a DBZ title. I just want the Non-Online achievements because ive already been a part of cancerous game communities online.

This game is like a love-hate relationship for me that's pretty much always hate. 


Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2D 3-on-3 based fighting game made by Ark Systems, based on the popular series of Dragon Ball Z. It's gameplay can be compared to Marvel vs Capcom at some points. I'll quickly go over the good and the bad.


The Good:
- The graphics
The game looks stunning when it is in motion. Colors and particle effects flow everywhere, and it's absolutely beautiful. The game uses models at 30 FPS to make it look like they're 2D characters, just like in the anime. Although I'm personally not a fan of the character's animations because of this, I can see why they went for it.

- The roster
The roster is simple and what you'd expect from a fighting game, unlike other DBZ games like Xenoverse, which can have upwards of 60+ characters. This game has a solid roster with all of the ""Main"" characters that appeared in the story. However, some are still missing like Super Buu, Raditz or Hercule(UNACCEPTABLE).

- The... story?
I'll be honest, the story IS bland by itself. But the only thing that saved it for me was the premise of Android 21.
Now I know what you're probably thinking: ""durr boobs lolololol"". No. I actually liked the fact that there was a new Android with something that we haven't really seen in a DBZ game or storyline at all yet(if we're not counting heroes, heroes is basically fanfic heaven). An Android who has the cells of a Majin that can absorb powers and eat you. Having such a looming threat that you've never encountered before is quite interesting.

What is the story itself, though? Some weird fucko makes everyone weak as hell like a video game so they can fight and become stronger, then #21 will eat them. 

... that's it

- Unlockable Characters
THANK GOD! Finally a game that allows you to UNLOCK characters!(only 3/11 characters are unlockable that aren't on the roster by default, those others... you have to pay for.)

The Bad:

- Online
Online is one of the most... strange, yet rage inducing thing about this video game. 9/10 times you will only see the exact same 3 characters online, which are usually either all Top Tier, or a certain meta(Vegeta for assist, an annoying character like Hit/Kid Buu, and some top tier character like Cell/Goku Black). It's not fun at all and it makes the gap between a low tier character like Piccolo extremely obvious when it comes to balancing. You might think that this just ends up giving you character knowledge, but it's not that easy.

- The combat
The combat is filled with ToD's, some bugs, and alot of cheap stuff. Defense in this game is extremely tough, and offense is rewarded greatly over defensive play. Projectiles can be really tough to dodge(but can be beaten using the ""Deflect"" mechanic, which can be done by pressing B+Ki blast), and super dashing can be spammed with 0 risk if you can't counter it in time. There's also teleports which costs 1 Ki bar, but these are beyond disgusting as they can be used to combo from the smallest things(like a ki blast). There are also Auto combos, which make the game very accessible, but if you can't deal with them turn this game into an absolute nightmare. Certain characters have a really good one like SSGSS Goku, which goes High Low Mid, which is fully guaranteed if you're unable to block one of the attacks.

- The balancing
There's no denying that some of these characters are extremely good, and some are very weak. Online play shows this off more than anything, but I've already discussed that.

- Chatting
There's no good way to chat with people in the lobby, albeit... this might be for the best.

45125257,english,"I don't play too many fighter games, so this has to be taken with a grain of salt, through the eyes of a novice.

It's surprisingly enjoyable - and I'm not sure if it's more about the Dragon Ball (well, it surely doesn't hurt) or the gameplay itself.

The graphics are so vivid, animations so fluid, that it's really a pleasure to watch fighters duke it out, especially given how fight affect the stage - expect destroying everything around you.

Gameplay is fast - full match won't take longer, than couple of minutes, though the pace of the game could mean, that one little slump will throw you straight into defeat. As some people mentioned here and there, fights are focused on comboing, whether you like it or not. Personally I don't have too much of an issue with that, but your mileage could vary  here.

The story mode is... Well, it is here, yes. Story wasn't exactly expansive, but I guess it fits DB in general. I had my fun though and learning style of each new character got me through the campaign without any problems.

The game itself seems to be a little bit pricy for the content available, especially given the availbility of Season Pass - but I've grabbed this on 50% sale (both game and the pass) and couldn't be happier with it.

45094844,english,"Now, before I get to the main review, let me say simply that I'm not usually a fan of fighting games, or Dragonball Z... yet was surprisingly drawn to this game. And after getting it, I am very glad I did. I have been having fun with it, and it has a lot of things that make somebody like me who usually dislikes fighting games (normally due to how complicated using a single move can be...) actually enjoy it.

So if it wasn't obvious, Dragonball FighterZ is a 2D fighting game based on the Dragonball characters.

Unlike a lot of fighting games this game is very streamlined to be newplayer friendly, while still allowing room for improvement for players who get better at the game. There's a few mechanics at play here to do this. There's natural mobility options (such as Vanish, which teleports you behind your opponent, or Super Dash which charges you straight at them) which prevent people from just using cheesy tactics from a distance. There's also the ""Auto Combo"", where combos have an automatic progression if you continue the same input (For example, repeatedly hitting Light Attack). Finally, the most complicated input is just a simple Quarter Circle, which even a newbie like me can get used to. This means a new player can pick it up, still do decent damage, but there is still a high skill ceiling as these tools start getting strung together. 

There is a lot of universal mechanics too, so all you need to worry about is what makes each character unique in their kit, as opposed to how you're going to get close enough to land a hit, or get out of a corner if you get pinned.

Overall these simple and new player friendly mechanics allow for a lot of interesting combat options to anybody who starts making use of them.

One bonus point I want to mention: A common issue with tag-team fighters, where you can just pin somebody's new character once you kill one, is acknowledged by a sort of reset when the new character comes in.

The music and art direction are also top-notch. There are times I legitimately forget this is entirely in 3D, due to the great use of artstyle. Plus, the game gives a great feeling of power, through how attacks interact with the environment (for example, if you deflect a projectile it might go into the BG and destroy a house), as well as ""Finishes"", which can change the stage mid-battle if you blow it up with a powerful finisher, or knock the opponent away with a heavy hit as a finisher. As such fights feel very dynamic, despite coming down to the same general ideas between areas.
I should also mention there's plenty of Easter Eggs, such as dramatic intros and finishes, depending on the match/stage setup, or some characters have special interactions depending on who you have on your team/are facing agains.

Finally, it's easy to set up an entire match lobby with friends. You join a server they are in, ya host, you all play 'king of the hill' style, or what have you.


So, issues. One is rage quitting is not punished. You don't get your win if your opponent ragequits, and they don't get a loss. At most they get flagged, and will show they ragequit alot when you get into a match.

Second: Ironically, casual is VERY dangerous for new players. It's highly likely you'll face players who have been playing a while and get destroyed. Ranked is actually the safer mode to get used to.

Third: DLC. While I personally have no issues buying a couple, since this isn't a recurring game and a lot of them are unexpected characters, I feel they are definitely overpriced for what they offer. You get a single character for a decently hefty sum.


So in summary, a great fighting game that is very new player friendly while still letting good players shine. It has a few issues in online situations, but overall it is an enjoyable experience.

45067835,english,"This is an extremely polished & well-made fighting game that I hope will be a mainstay in the fighting game community. 

+ The artstyle is gorgeous, and the gameplay is just as great. I've spent literal hours in training mode before, just trying to get one combo, and it doesn't bother me one bit because of how satisfying the game feels & looks. 

+ The roster is fairly well-balanced; unless you're playing at very high levels you can use a team of just about anyone. 

+ The game is welcoming to beginners. The learning curve that may seem harsh at first glance, but really isn't as bad as you'd think once you put some time into it. 

+ DLC isn't required to be top tier, and the each DLC character is extremely unique and brings new variety to the team structure & roster as a whole. I would recommend buying the season pass so you can try out every character. You'll find yourself loving the characters you never would've thought of playing.

I realize giving this game such high praise may make me sound like a shill, but I honestly had never watched DBZ and barely knew anything about the show before buying the game & I still had a ton of fun with the game as a whole. 

Story mode's kinda boring tho.

I can say that this game is amazing, BUT, only for a very specific crowd, people who enjoy classic fighting games, like street fighter, king of fighters, or in this particular case, marvel vs capcom.

The reason i say that is because this type of game in the DBZ series is not common, in fact the last time we saw something like this was in Super Dragon Ball, a port from the japanese arcades to the ps2, and let's say that, that game had flaws and was not generally accepted.

The thing is, when you think about the classic style of dbz fighting games, people will either go for budokai or tenkaichi, since those are the most common predecessors of the franchise. And this game dosen't take anything from any of those two types of gameplay.

For me honestly it was a blast seeing the game coming to this point since day 1 , discovering what the characters could do, the crazy stuff people would show online, the level of gameplay that increased more and more as time goes by.

Everything was sincerelly good.

The only thing i think that would make it even better would be a more classic DBZ story mode with the anime soundtrack, but i guess we can't have everything xD.

So all in all, i'm glad we finally have a good game for DBZ after so many years of different ideas not really adding up much and i hope for more of course, but as the game is right now, i can only say thank you to everyone who made this game possible.

I will say I am a huge fan of the series and love rewatching it over and over while I wait for more episodes to release. I will say however that fighterz was not my cup of tea personally.

I can understand why people enjoy it and I kind of wish there was a meh option besides do you recommend this game or nah? visually its amazing I was running on max settings with a 1070 no problem and no frames below 60.

44897416,english,"I am writing this review from a slightly different perspective than others. I primarily play this game with my wife on local play with maybe a match here or there online everyso often. 

Pro's
- Local play is fun and competative for both casual players and hardcore.
- Autocombo's allow inexperienced players to understand the basics of gameplay
- Combat is dynamic and complex with 3v3 roster combat.
- The Cel shaded graphics make it look just like the show, at times I wish they animated the series this way.
- Great selection of characters as the roster is still expanding, hoping for a season 2 as well.
- Combat is balanced well, with only a few characters being left out to dry. (Looking at you Lord Beerus)
- Online play, what little I have done, seems to run well with 3ms latency at most.
- Practice mode allows you to practice with with latency delays and recorded/visual inputs.
- Cinematic fights are unreal, very fun to play, but also fun to watch.

Cons
- Slim map selection, DLC has not added any new fighting arenas.
- Rage quitters not really punished all that much online.
- A lot of Goku/Vegeta characters. Would like to see more female characters, currently only 2.
- Costume changes are restricted to colour variants only. Something about needing to model each costume by hand.
- Have a X-Arcade Tankstick and can only really program the left side to work, player 2 needs to use controler or seperate USB fightstick.

+looks amazing
+dragonball
+plays very well (smooth animation, good performance, excellent graphics on PC (console is meh))
+plays very well - game tempo, ease of learning, execution of specials and combos. some people feel like this game is offense heavy which i agree with and would call a plus. i do wish there were more defensive options, but i feel it may be as simple as making reflect a lot stronger so that it actually rewards you all the time for successful reflect, instead of leading to getting smashed by autocombo vs certain toons and setups
+buttons feel great on most toons (there are caveats)
+balance - most of the cast is somewhere in the middle of a normal curve for viability, with bardock kinda alone at the top and maybe beerus at the bottom (alas). the 1.5 balance patches so far have been well conceived and executed
+the attention paid to this game is evident in a lot of places

meh - lobby system good and bad, mostly bad honestly. being able to flash the cell powerup face is funny, but it isnt worth having to join a lobby to play online. the biggest problem is that, especially right after release, the lobbies fill up and then you just spend your time trying to find a game. that is wack
meh - netcode. it is technically good but loses points for lag toggle being a thing
meh - super dash is wacky which can sometimes benefit you and sometimes nut on you. it does make the game more fun casually, but might be a negative in competitive play. no one wants to lose for RNG reasons in an otherwise (mostly?) deterministic game

-ragequitters are still a thing
-drm maybe had a hand in breaking the game for some pc players, is probably reducing performance, and
-bamco kinda sucks at the hosting portion or whatever they do? i refuse to blame the developer for this even if they were the ones who rolled out the patch that broke the game for 2 weeks+ for certain pc players. mind you not all of them, and some sort of trick with launching another game to fool the anticheat or whatever sorta fixed it by letting you join lobbies but im pretty sure online games didnt work anyway. additionally the patch did not seem to be for the client because it broke on a monday or maybe sunday night, i assume it was server-side and could have been hosted with a party other than bamco (anticheat or drm people?). the first line support people are good and responsive but the executives responsible for the support division or public relations are trash tier. they didnt even put out some kind of PSA on a website somewhere stating they knew about the problem and were working on it. this is not the fault of the regular support people, they aren't the ones who put out public releases for the company; the execs are.",1536275989,1537489002,TRUE,0,0,0.504220307,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,85,2,35603,77,12667,1601005854

A rumble feature would definitely help with determining stage position.  In other fighting games, a good rumble feature allows me to take my eyes off of my character, and watch my opponent.  Especially in this game, where all of the characters look the same, taking my eyes off of one yellow haired character requires more of a tactile connection with the game, for maximum comfort, and mastery.  That isn't to say that I won't get good at the game eventually, it is to say that learning it feels very dissociative, after playing with rumble feedback for so many years.

The graphics are pretty cool and the game play seems fairly advance, but there aren't terribly many combos to be had with each character.  There are only a few special moves, which kind of sucks, but there are nearly all of the DBZ characters to play with, and a nice combo system, which is awesome.

""Failed to initiate Network."" with Win 8.1

I was able to play during some days after the base Goku and Vegeta release, then, suddenly no connection allowed to the online lobby.

2 solutions (found by the users) :
- Play on Win7 or Win10 OS
- Launch PUBG or Fortnite before connect to the lobby

The second option sounds crazy but seems to work for many people.
Upgrading your Windows to 10 is not a 100% guaranteed solution : people still experience issues with connection to the lobby and versus matches.


If you plan to play offline on the same device with friends, the game is worth.
If your target is the ranked versus online => I recommend to test your connection to the online lobby first. 
If it works => Kamehameha
Failed to initiate Network => Request for a refund (before 2 hours playtime)

44578686,english,"I deliberated a bit about whether to recommend. I really love this game but it has some major flaws too. I decided that the best way to do this is I'm gonna front load all the bad stuff about the game but put it as a recommended title. I don't want anyone buying it and not knowing what their getting into.

The Bad:
- MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: There is DRM and Anti-Cheat software. Now I understand that anti-cheat software is necessary on games like this where the primary focus is a competitive ladder. However, Easy Anti-Cheat is borderline spyware and very invasive. You cannot opt out and if you go in and remove it the hard way, you will have your account potentially banned. So if you have sensitive info stored on your computer, don't install this.
- Servers are kinda spotty and lower capacity than you would want, resulting in people being booted out frequently especially during high traffic hours. This can be really frustrating.
- The game was clearly designed with a lootbox economy in mind. While there have never been paid lootboxes, the devs kept the lootbox system in anyway. While all the ""important content"" namely characters and play modes, is available either from the start or after completing story mode, half the alternate character pallets, emotes, avatars and other content are all locked up in the lootboxes, which can ONLY be purchased with in game currency. You are not guarenteed unique items each time but you can't get duplicates either so you just get premium currency at a trickle rate for each time you roll a duplicate. Only with premium currency are you guarenteed a new item. So if you care about alternative pallets, get ready to grind for them because there is no alternative.
- Story mode is pretty boring. There's some funny dialogue but the story is awful and its way longer than it should be. Additionally, Android 21 cannot be unlocked without completing the story mode (I've heard there is was a way to get her through her Z-Union but I think this was removed as an option).
- Matchmaking can be a bit confusing when you first get into competitive.
- Bamco's PR/Customer service is attrocious and recently a significant number of players, primarily those using windows 8.1, were locked out of the online play mode for two weeks straight, due to a faulty update the the DRM. The PR team failed to contact the community publicly in any way about the status of the issue and what was being done until it was fixed to weeks later, in the mean time leaving those affected frustrated and concerned.
- The lobby system is kinda dumb and confusing and it can be challenging to figure out the controls when you get into the game for the first time. (hint: options menu is Tab rather than the usual ESC)
- Setting up controllers for two players on PC for local can be quite a hastle to get working. You may need to sacrifice a rooster or something to get both controllers assigned correctly.
- Online matchmaking can be really slow.

Now for The Good:
-Beautiful graphics, voice acting and animation. Lots of attention to detail and kits that really capture each characters fighting style, big moments and personality.
-Thriving online community.
-A replay system both for your own matches and for following and watching games from high ranked players which can really help with learning the game's strategy.
-Good Practice mode with lots of options
-Probably one of the best designed fighting games I've played.
-Easy for beginners to learn and feel good due to auto-combos and other newbie helper mechanics.
-DLC characters are pretty reasonably priced.
-Probably my third favorite fighting game franchise to date, following Guilty Gear and Skull Girls.

Nitpicks:
-I kinda wish arcade mode didn't have the same teams to play against every time.
-If you love zoning characters, know that the game is kinda stacked against them and there are really only three of them.

44645998,english,"I'm gonna be honest, I fucking love this game to death. It's an amazing introduction to the Anime fighter genre, and has a lot of aspects of other fighters such as UMvC3 and Guilty Gear, all with the nostalgic feel of Dragon Ball, jam-packed with ORIGINAL voice actors, scenes and whatnot.

However, this, on PC, is the only thing it has going for itself. Get it for PS4, if you plan on getting serious with this game at all. PC has LESS natural input lag but (in my opinion) has worse latency due to the PC player's internets/or the netcode being not so good. 

The single-player campaign to unlock Android 21 for free, is 6 hours of nonstop bot-beating with the most HORRENDOUS way to teach you simple mechanics. Also the combo challenges aren't even proper BnB combos. 

If you want to learn the game, go on Youtube, or the DBFZ Subreddit discord. They'll help you there as long as you're open to critisism and being bodied by Cell, A16 and Adult Gohan lots of times. 

As of now, I've hit 800k Battle Points in ranked, have kept a Pink Square for god KNOWS how long and consider myself someone who knows how to play the game and knows most of the mechanics and character nuances. This is my online experience in a nutshell:

Rage Quitters: The only thing you get from Rage-Quitting too much is a purple name, you don't even lose rank if you quit out before the KO.

Unstable Connections: Even on a 4-bar I was getting spikes, frame drops and certain moves/directional blocks just didn't come out. On PS4, I never had this issue.

Spammers/Lag Abusers: If your opponent has a 2-bar connection or worse, do NOT play them. I repeat, do not play them unless you want to deal with frame drops, input drops, or wonky connection spikes where the frame delay can jump to 12 frames of input lag.

Frequent Disconnects: ""Failed to Initialize Network"". ""Connection has been Lost.""

Fight Stick Support: If you're unlucky like my first fight stick, your stick will not register ANYTHING or just be all messed up, even in Big Picture mode.

I'm probably forgetting some other things but I've already uninstalled and I don't want to go check.

TL;DR: Don't buy this for PC, get it for PS4. The online experience is better tenfold and you'll be ready for tournaments without having to learn a new amount of input lag.

40497560,english,"[h1] A Masterpiece. [/h1]
Enough said. Before I judge its virtues and vices, I should point out that this is one of the best fighting games I've ever played. Granted, I haven't played too much competitive fighting games [spoiler](I've only really been engaged with Street Fighter II, Super Smash Bros, and Tekken)[/spoiler], but that goes to show how accessible this game really is. 

And you want to know the best part? I haven't even seen a single episode of the anime it's based on. 

[h1] [ + ] The Pros [/h1][list]
[*][i]Fan Service and Graphics:[/i] There I said it! I've never actually seen a Dragon Ball episode. Regardless of my ignorance, I can sense the vigirous fan service and art style the developers poured into this game. Whether you care about the anime or not, every match and stage is littered with a brilliant color palette, completemented with masterful cinematic pieces while using your specials. It's practically eye-candy.

[*][i]Accessability and Difficulty:[/i] Personally, I enjoy games with high-difficulty spikes that cause the player to really think and attempt to comprehend the mechanics of the game they're playing. However, this style of playing is not for everyone, which DBFZ addresses efficiently to anyone with virtually any playstyle.
You want to play the game casually? Sure, just mash the X button and you'd still have a blast with the action. You want to play the game competitively? You're in for a treat, because this game expands upon the precedented traditional fighting rock-paper-scissors scheme with a revolutionary mechanic; the super-dash. It prevents the atrocious projectile spam that other games struggle with, and makes this game even more fast-paced than it already is.

[*][i]Unlockables:[/i] Nowadays, microtransactions and lootboxes plague the gaming industry. However, this game sticks with its old fighting game roots, and let's all the content (at least until the Season Pass is fleshed out) to be accessable via story mode and arcade mode. No more squeezing the extra buck to unlock SSGSS Goku.... unless you really want to. 
[/list]
[h1] [ - ] The Cons [/h1][list]
[*][i]Character Variety:[/i] Whilst writing this, I do think this game's only issue is it's character variety. Although there's 20-something characters to choose from, some characters feel too alike, in terms of style (albeit all of them are different in gameplay). To illustrate my point, there's 3 different Goku characters, 2 different Vegeta characters, and a few characters very similiar in DB's lore (such as Kid Buu and Majin Buu). It's not a big deal, but it feels somewhat lacking in this department right now.
[/list]
[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]
There's really nothing else to say. The matchmaking has been fixed so it's not valid criticism, anymore. Moreover, most of the flaws with DBFZ are nitpicks, rather than major obstacles (such as poor lip-sync dubbing). All in all, just buy the game if it seems slightly interesting. It's highly likely you'll have a great time; assuming you don't despise 2D competitive fighters.",1519944433,1535654407,TRUE,1,0,0.496732026,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,89,4,24754,0,13848,1591070504

Then you have infinite combos.
I dont care how much skill it takes to pull this off, if you use it, you shouldnt own the game because you basically arent playing it, The moment someone is caught in an infinite combo, the fun is immedietly ruined,y ou cant do anything against it and if you ever somehow get dropped out of it, Your thrown back into it again in roughly 5 seconds because you cant hit your opponent while they turtle in the corner.

44406483,english,"Unless you're SonicFox or you actually like Xenoverse, do not but this piece of sh it. Here's why:

Offline:

- A fighter is locked behind a boring story mode
- Gameplay is super repetitive outside of pvp

Online:

- 1 casual match = about 15 min wait time
- Casual matching is secretly Ranked match Jr.
- ""Oh look, a fighter within my skill range. Maybe I can get a feel of the mechanics better without getting duffed by long combo strings."" (player ragequits mid-fight) ""...uhh......good game????"" (he stood still for about 15 seconds, THEN he left for those who think it might have been a random disconnect)
- Backpedalling and camping, spamming everything from beams to Vegeta SSJ = no-skill win
- Cell, Kid Buu, and literally any third char (Vegeta most likely) = tier-whore win
- Played with a person who give me a very close, yet fun match. No ability to friend them, couldn't see what their Steam name was, never saw that person again......
- Pinks (highest threat level) trolling around Casual as Whites or Greens (some of the lowest threat levels)
- 'Those' players who are beating your a$$, then the moment you get momentum........LAG SPIKE!!!!!
- One button auto-combo/auto-mixup shenanigans depending on char

I personally don't like getting basically infinitely wall combo'd to oblivion. I actually would like to PLAY my fighting game. I'll stick with Xenoverse and hope they fix what's broken in that.

44357061,english,"This game is......hard to critique.

On one hand, the game is practically dripping with polish and care for the Dragon Ball Franchise, with the developers making a lot of inside jokes and references, a solid roster of characters with a lot of big names on deck like Trunks, Hit, and Freeza, and a wealth of cutscenes and cinematics that honestly look really good.

Why negative then? Simple. The actual game itself is a cancerous mess.

After nearly 400 hours of playing on and off over the last several months, I have found that the game has buggy mechanics, stupid design choices, and poor balance to say the least. Not even bringing up the fact that most fighters feel very homogenous, which makes the cast feel identical to play, even if they have a great deal of different moves (I'm looking at you Piccolo).

For example, lets look at the game's most prominent mechanic: Super Dash. Super Dash on its own is a buggy mess, only really working properly in dedicated combos and strings. However, that is only the beginning of the problem. Super Dash essentially blocks all ki attacks, and also zooms you toward the enemy. Seems cool, right? The problem with this is that any non-ki projectile takes too long to startup to punish it on reaction. This means that the only real good way of punishing it is with Anti Air moves.

Anti Air moves are invincible to any air attack, yet they are their own cavalcade of terrible. With Aerial moves(since aerial moves have NO LAG ON WHIFF (which is its own problem)), it is possible to use an anti air move, be invincible to the aerial attack, they land, making them able to block, and then you miss an attack you should have hit because you just did a down-heavy on someone's guard which you weren't expecting to be possible, meaning you're about to get combo'd. On Super Dash, the timing window seems very inconsistent, even though I know it isn't. There are times when I've hit down heavies I KNOW I shouldn't have, and missed ones that were timed perfectly.

Then there's vanish. Aside from vanish occassionally making down-heavies miss if they are performed a frame too early(forcing the game's shitty crossup protection to get you hit), vanish also ruins the neutral game. Any assist-> vanish is a free setup that leaves the defender at a HEAVY disadvantage if they block, and taking nearly 10% of their max health if they don't. In addition, it also makes combos that shouldn't have been possible now VERY possible, allowing people to spam buttons in the air, and then vanish near the ground for a full(albeit slightly scaled) combo.

This is not even getting into the problems with the game's combo system making everyone feel the same to play, design decisions that make characters WORSE in order to fit into that combo structure, automatic crossup protection, aerial side switch lock, or the numerous other shitty bits of the game that worm their way into ranked and casual play.

This game is......frustrating. As a designer and a fighting game enthusiast, it makes me sad thinking about all the love and talent that went into making the game a steaming garbage fire to play. Sure the game is fun for the first fifty hours, and that is likely going to be enough for people. For the hardcore crowd however, who put thousands upon thousands of hours into mastering the game's systems and understanding every nuance, this game is a frustrating grind that had me and my friends screaming and hurling controllers when alone, and frustrated when we played together.

PROS:
English and Japanese voice acting for us weebs
Fast combo system
Beautiful graphics style
Good roster
Lots of modes
Move sets and combos give every character a unique feel.

CONS:
No way of player to player communication
Hard to play without a remote
3 gokus and 3 vegetas, I personally don't mind too much as they aren't too similar but I see a lot of complaints about this and feel it's worth mentioning to the less intense fans of the series.
In Online Matches your framerate is forced to match the other player's, I think, so even if you get 60 FPS you'll get stuck with players with 30 occasionally and the game will run terribly.

Overall I'd give this game a solid 10/10. It's been a ride if I'm being honest, for several months post release the servers were very bad and basically ruined the game. Luckily they were fixed a while back and now they don't seem to have issues aside from the random EAC Disconnect: Peer Untrusted. If you love Dragon Ball or Marvel Vs.

44067240,english,"I played this game up until I realized how they ignore the community when it comes to their own opinion on DLC. This is a personal opinion however so take it with a grain of salt. DLC should add more content worth buying not getting one character for 5 bucks. It is obvious that they are trying to milk this and ill continue too. (Now onto the gameplay and such)

So I can reccommend this game to those who enjoy the story and PVE content because it does have a bit of a decent story and of course the free battle and training system. Unlockables are cosmetic from what ive seen so far just to have a fancy avatar. However if you expect to unlock secret characters other than 21 and just different colors. I guess there is a reason I don't play anime fighters too much then again I have only played 2 and one was playstation era. If this was a bigger game it might be worth the money however you would more likely get more content out of Shinobi Striker.  

So in conclusion I will only say if you love DBZ and like custom stories then get it. Other than that I can honestly say I regret buying this game. I would get a refund if I could, but I was dumb enough to buy it and expect to get good at the game which was fun for awhile until Bardock and Broly. Arc is too greedy for my tastes and a game should not be over 100$ for full content.

44032121,english,"Online Matchmaking is a joke, stay away. Can't get any matches.

Game itself is a very solid and fun fighter. Story mode is way too easy for way too long, and since the available characters at the outset are very limited, it quickly becomes tedious. It really doesn't have enough single player content to really be viable as a single player game.  This game was clearly meant to be played against other people. That is where it truly shines. Unfortunately, trying to play against another person online is an excrutiating and unecessarily slow experience. ~10+ minutes between matches is too much. The terrible and unecessary ""lobby"" just makes a huge problem even worse. 

Until they significantly overhaul Matchmaking, just stay away.

Edit: Read some guides online and figured out how to ""optimize"" my chances of getting a match. Played a few matches online, and for the most part they played really well. But there is still an incredibly long wait time between matches, and hopping between servers/modes to try and find a match really really sucks. We are talking 10 minutes in between matchers, which only last a couple minutes themselves.

40885320,english,"Amazing game! But Truth be told? Not sure the ultimate edition is worth it, hell not even the FighterZ edition. I bought the ultimate edition but truthfully it was definitely not worth 100$. While i love the anime and its music i dont think paying 100$ for it is worth it. Theres nothing ingame that you cant obtain by simply playing it, that being said if i knew that id have just bought the 60$ version.

Pros:
-Fluid Combat
-Story short enough for those who just want the unlocks, long enough for those who want to enjoy the content of the DragonBall world
-Great Servers (Overall)
-Very populated
-Dedicated DEV team always making patches and updates
-Easy learning curve

Cons:
-You really have to commit to ""git gud"" otherwise youll probably get destroyed by experienced players 
-Repetitive matches. 90% chance you'll fight an Adult Gohan, Cell, Goku Black, or Android 16 every game. even moreso because these characters are a wee bit overpowered
-Really hard to put together a team of 3 in the beginning. (Figuring out synergy and the best all around team composition)
-Few defensive options. Really easy to find yourself getting infinetely combo looped and youll feel like there's little to NOTHING you can do about it.

Overall as a fighting game i'd say its a success, even moreso a success as a Dragon Ball tribute. To my 90s babies, its no Budokai 3 but the fast paced action definitely puts it on par if not above it. It's a good game to play and will reward you for commiting to it. Even if you're not a Dragon Ball fan but you're looking for a game that'll have your heart beating? This one's it for sure!

Update- 8/10/2018: I find myself getting bored of this game very quickly. While i come back to join the hype with all the new DLC chars being released, i always leave the game for the very same reason: Its boring. Unless ur a fighting game fanatic and you have infinite combos written on ur brain, if ur on the receiving end of fighting players like that? You'll just wanna drop the controller. The game has been out for a fair amount of time now and literally it seems the playerbase (atleast on PC) is just filled with button mashing. Hell even if ur the one wooping ass the game still feels...idk. Its hard to explain. But if you play online alot the lack of defensive tools the game provides to you will just take away from all the fun. You'll just wanna drop your controller or DC all together. I love the game, and the idea of it,  but it is in dire need of a ""Combo breaker"" mechanic, maybe you can spend a bar or 2 to give yourself some space, im not sure. But the combat system is literally ""first one to land a hit wins"", and the fight wont be fun unless its you vs a friend or a random person, you guys are on an even level skillwise, and there r no infinite loops being used. This does not change my opinion about the game, its good, but the combat system definitely doesnt deliver.",1521329017,1533930911,TRUE,19,3,0.705122173,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,22,1,27240,0,15206,1590242096

43995178,english,"Alright so many reviews say that the game is ""easy to pick up but hard to master"" but that is not true. From my experiences playing the game, queues are incredibly long and when you do find a match the other player is either A LOT better than you or lacks a stable wifi connection for the match to be playable. The game itself can have you learn around 4 or 5 of the charcters if you'd like in around 5-6 hours if you put enough work into ranked or consistently go on practice. The queues are the main thing in my opinion that should be changed seeing how myself with my current record or 48-44 is going up against players with much higher win rates despite me having the queue settings not allow that from happening which is quite dumb. I think the main thing they can do to fix this is to have the queues like Ninja Storm where someone makes a party on ranked while someone joins and the players in the party can see eachothers stats to either accept or decline the match. 

The graphics are very great with the backround designs and playing in enviroments looks very nice and doesn't lack much creativity. All of the characters blend in great and designs are very good in the scenery. Attacks are very satisfying with each combo or heavy hit looking like they have weight to them. However I did see some inputs of attacks to perform specials were delayed and some attacks on ranked did get floppy which made my hits completely not connect, making my opponents get the upper hand and comboing off of it.

The game all together is not made for a casual player, take it from me I learned it the hard way when thinking that matches would be a lot more simpler which ended up being my downfall in the ranks. However if you are into games like MVC, Injustice, or Guilty Gear then this is the game for you and you'd have a blast depending on how you'll get used to the combat and approaches that characters have in the game.

So this was the first fighting game I picked up. I really had no idea what to expect. I had never been into fighting games nor had any experience in the technical aspect of it. Coming into this was VERY frustrating, but once I took the time to sit down and start learning it was completely worth it. The online can be a little laggy at times and the it's hard for someone who was in my position, but once you start getting the moves down you can see the difference. I've noticed I'm starting to be able to compete with Yellow and some Orange square people which in the beginning would have totally beat me in. Seeing that progress was dope and the community is extremely helpful to people who are new to it. 

All and all, take the time to learn the game. Some advice I was given was that you're gonna get kicked in A LOT and that's the time to learn from those people and your mistakes.

43963122,english,"A glorified button masher.
A List of why I hate this game. 
The only things good about this game:  It looks beautiful and the characters are balanced but unique. Now for the bad.

Verdict : 60 buck is too much for a game that is gorgeous but... it's still just a simple fighting game with big problems.
Get it on sale for around 30 bucks and it MIGHT be worth it for casuals.
But since you still need to pay more for DLC characters...just don't get this game if your tight on money.

The connection issues ruin the game...no one seems to have a perfect connection and only some are ""decent"".
But in a fast paced fighter every bit counts a lot.
Another big issue is that the fighting mechanics are just bad. It seems to only be about attacking like crazy, making sure you do your near infinite combo correctly and has very little to do with watching your enemies movements. So the game gets BORING really fast even if you win a lot. Its kinda like a glorified button masher.
Defense tactics like reflect blocking practically do nothing, charging ki and getting dragon balls is a joke because the game is too fast for those features to ever happen in a real match.

The game looks gorgeous, it uses a 3D/2D style mix very similar to the anime using similar animation work  as Guilty Gear Xrd series which is a great fit given its source material. It has a storefront where you can buy colors, titles, avatars and stuff using the zenny you earn in the story and arcade modes which can work as a small distraction if you want a reason to keep playing but wont sway too many people unless theyre completionists.

if there are any cons its that it starts to feel a bit repetative,  especially if your a casual fighting game fan. the story gets old real fast with a short original story  and the offerings spread as far as your typical arcade modes, tutorials etc, and of course its online which will likely be its lifeblood. it doesnt hurt the game itself in particular but its likely only going to hold the interest of hardcore fighting game and DBZ fans .

===========================================

This is one of the few times I am going out of my way to write a review. I am a huge Dragon Ball (specifically Z) fan. This game, however, is not for Dragon Ball fans. Well, more specifically, it is not for fans who are not willing to commit to a serious fighting game.

Say what you will about how complex this game is compared to other competitive fighting games out there. Objectively speaking, you need to be able to do a lot of button combinations fast if you want to get any good at this game. Not to mention you will need a competent controller as well (I had gone through multiple controllers before I found the one singular controller that seemed to work best with this game... then it stopped working). I cannot believe just how finnicky these combos are. It is so frustrating when you know you are doing the inputs correctly, but the D-Pad is being pressed in ever-so-slightly the incorrect way and it ruins your entire combo.

This is a fighting game first, and a Dragon Ball game second. If you are a more casual fan who is looking to have some fun without having to commit a lot of time and effort into learning the complexities of the gameplay, this is not the game for you. You can slog through the repetitive story mode just fine, but if you want to do any of the challenge/tutorial modes... have fun. This game has stressed and frustrated me more than it has entertained me. ""If it's [the game] not fun, why bother?"" ~Reggie Fils-Aimé. Unfortunately for me, I like completing my games to a certain point, so I'm still torturing myself trying to complete all of these combo tutorials and hard level arcade modes.

43888744,english,"Unless you're prepared to spend the next few weeks in your room, smashing away your buttons, I do not recommend this game. DragonBallFighterZ has already been out awhile, I should have taken that as a hint not to plunge into it. But having become accustomed to fighting games over the years and having a nearly 90% win rate in over 200 battles in Street Fighter IV as well as Mortal Kombat X. I thought for certain I could handle another, I mean what's the worst that could happen?

Well a lot can happen if you plunge in late. For one, Online mode is a ghost town. And the only people that play are already in the 1200+ wins category. But even after having learned the basics, and having mastered the mechanics. I quickly realized this is no Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. DragonBallFighterZ has a skill gap that would take even someone like me a good while to reach, and would undoubtedly be impossible for a newcomer to a fighting game to ever even touch.

In short, you will be decimated in 65+ hit combos and get KO'd before you can even think of what to do properly. The people here are here to stay and they play this game for a living. They've mastered it, and I respect that. I don't have anything against these players. But it makes the game unreachable for people that are just starting out now.

TL;DR: The skill gap is insanely high, too high. The game is a ghost town online except for the occasional veterans wondering the lobbies that will drop you in a heartbeat.

43764909,english,"Dragon Ball Fighterz is one of the only fighting games I've played often in a wihle since not many fighting games of this gen has caught my eye, maybe marvel infinite but on pc it's difficult to find people now. I will admit I am a big dragon ball fan so I am a bit of a fanboy but the game itself is rad. 
Pros:
-Obviously it's a gorgeous looking game. Looks a lot like the anime and arcs shading again is really impressive, just fantastic ohw they pulled it off.
-Fun characters, while many have a problem with having te same bread and butter combos, I do think most of the characters are enjoyable to use and feel nice, especially yamcha, he is great.
-Music is absolutely phenominal, there hasn't been a db game with a soundtrack this good since budokai 3 in my opinion and this ost is justt amazing.
-Fast paced and fun 3v3 gameplay. The game feels so smooth to control, the moves, thhe combos, they just all feel so satisfying!
-Personality. This game has so much damn personality and so many references call backs and nods to dragonball it's insane and it just adds more charm
However, this isn't a perfect game and people who dislike it  I can understand.
Cons:
-Defensive options. Holy shit the defense in this game is really bad, you have a parry+push block thatt is best if you have gohan who slides in with his sweep but honestly this mechanic just isn't close to as good as thhe regular push block from mvc3. Next is guard cancel, guard cancel is good when you have one character left. other than that, it's really bad, a lot of times when used, your other character will fly right into a combo instead of just breaking it or it'll be blocked and punished. I feel this game could really use a push block and the guard cancel mechanic should be how it is when you have one character left.
-Single player option. The story is decent but not great and it's the only way to unlock 21, it's not bad and it has a lot of options compared to sfv launch but it could be better.
-online. Yes here we go, Online is still poor. It's not close to as bad as it was launch and it works well on ranked and such, however, you can't just make a lobby and invite friends, instead you have to tell them to join a certain lobby, find you and then join your ring match. It's obnoxious, slow, and so silly. 
-Roster could be better. SSj goku, SSB goku, base goku, ssj vegeta, ssb vegeta, base vegeta...Need I say more? I think this game could really benefit from more females also, like videl, chichi, zangya, or kefla. Honestly we got a few too many Gokus.
-Bardock. Cell. Kid buu. That's it...
Overall, I still love this game and if you love db and or 3v3 fighters, I say give it a chance, it's a damn fun game and it's easier to pick up and play than other fighters!

Its quite easy to get into, super polished and well optimized, it looks amazing and super well animated, the soundtrack is great and even tho it has weird and kinda shoe'd-in rpg elements, the campaign is a must for any dragonball fans.

42832220,english,"Honestly not my cup of tea. Definitely not a bad game by any means, but the time it takes to git gud is way too steep for me. I'm not a fan of fighters that are this focused on combos; not because I can't do them, but rather because they bore and frustrate me. In Street Fighter, King of Fighters (14 specifically), or Tekken, combos can deal a lot of damage, but they're less common since you usually have to get in close to start them. And then, they're usually short, sweet, and to the point. Badabing badaboom, like 15 seconds at max, that's a third of the enemy's health bar. In this, almost any attack can lead into a 30+ hit combo that lasts 45 seconds, dealing the same amount of damage. Most of the time, I'm just sitting there, mashing buttons to tech out in case they drop the combo (which they won't: the combo system is dead easy for better or worse)

I'm also not a fan of the overwhelming offensive capabilities in the game. You can call in assists to lock your opponent down while you go for a mixup, leading to yet another super long combo. It gets to the point where I can't even learn defensive techniques because I'm barely playing. I'm just watching my team get combo'd to death for 4 minutes. It may open up and become a lot more fun once you learn the ins and outs, how to defend and punish and all that, but the punishment is so harsh I feel I can't take it anymore. 

I don't think the game is bad, but it's not for me. If you're ok with not even really playing for 30 hours as you try to learn how to actually defend, totally go for it. It's a gorgeous, satisfying game with some really fun mechanics. However, if long combos and crazy pressure make you go ""hmm,"" stay away. I'll be sticking with Street Fighter, Tekken, and Guilty Gear, and I'll probably get fewer strokes due to sheer frustration.

TLDR: Excellent fighter, but I cannot recommend it to people with low salt thresholds such as myself

I have managed to temporarily fix the issue somehow after I had first bought it, but today, it has stopped working, and no matter how much I repeat what I did when I first fixed it, it won't solve the problem.
Furthermore, I'm having several other issues: There's a lack of support for the controllers I use which I had to bypass in strange ways, I have to go in fullscreen mode if I want the best possible resolution while borderless windowed mode won't let me get to that, and even then, I have to revert it back to windowed mode before leaving the game or else it crashes every time I boot it up afterwards unless I delete the configuration save file manually.

This game is quite a bit of fun from what I could try of my first and only sessions. However, I intended to play it locally with others, and that kind of tedious fumbling around just to play it once is exactly what drives these others away from it.

43528606,english,"Kinda tricky to recommend games like these because it mostly depends on who is playing it and what is their preference on what kind of fighting game they like. Because comparing Marvel and Street Fighter, is kinda like comparing dodgeball and chess, competition games that are extremely different despite being in the same genre because they both have their own unique system and way to play. With that said, I'd say DBFZ end ups more on the Marvel side of the spectrum rather than the Street Fighter one.

If you're dedicated enough to learn this game, then go for it, learning combos is fun and testing out characters is interesting. Playing this with friends is a jolly good time. Not to mention, it's Dragon Ball, so most of what you pull off, will make your combos will look cool and stylish as all hell. But with that said, there's a point to be made here, because I feel like this game rewards aggressive play too much, and there are a few defensive options, leading to a lot of matches where either things go great for you or *everything* goes wrong (Pretty much like Marvel 3). And I'm saying this being a guy who loves playing rushdown characters in fighting games, but here, I feel that something like a push-block is missing.

Now, about the graphics, this game is BEAUTIFUL, ArcSystem really did an amazing job here, being the guys who did Guilty Gear XRD, I'm not one bit surprised this looks so good as it is. The animations, visual effects, camera work, everything in this department is just so done right. I consider this game a masterpiece in this regard. I can't express enough in words how much I love the polish of graphics and fan service in this game, this is something you have to see for yourself in case you actually end up buying this thing.

Overall, this game is fantastic, a very beautiful masterpiece of a game, but, I always lean on the fact that even masterpieces have their flaws, and this game sure does have some unfortunaley.

My name is Mushroom, of the Meals of Destruction.
Yeah, I guessed as much.
Yeast on the insides of your enemies.
How easily you ignore the sharpening of knife when it suits your convenience.
So tell me.
Who saves the meal from the man who saves the meal?
You're the ones salting them.
You take advantage from their lack of taste.
Of course they lack taste when you set them up as organic food!
Eat or be eaten, Jack.
Nom Yum taught me that.
Yes, you aren't the only one to grow up on the cooking fields.
Cooking is a cruel class, but an effective teacher.
Its final lesson is carved deep in my knife:
That this fridge and all its vegetables, are rotten.
Boiling is a myth, frying is a joke.
We are all prawns, controlled by something greater:
Spices. The DNA of the taste.
They shape our taste buds.
They are the plates -- They are everything we eat on.
Expose someone to hunger long enough, they will learn to eat.
They become a curryer; Salt, curry, despair ...
They're spices. All passed along the table.
How about ""full of schnit""?
Is that a spice?
You can't fight nurture, Jack.
The fan blows, water boils, and the hot prey upon the sweet.
Sam tells me you see your spoon as a tool.
Something that solves hunger -- making meals of justice.
Now that's pretty spicy. EXQUISITE!
It's spared you the burden of all the meals you've salted ...
Absolved you of guilt when you enjoyed it.
That is, until the illusion was boiled.
Don't be ashamed, it's only nurture, running its course.
You have no meals to make.
Nothing to answer for.
You can eat with a clear taste bud.
You're right.
About me, I mean.
I knew something was ... off.
After I turned off the stove.
I thought I could walk off the cooking field, and into a normal restaurant.
But here I am, surrounded by burned food, arguing cooking with one-star chefs.
I told myself this was about preparation, about cutting the leak.
But I was wrong.
Then you admit it?
I learned young that spicing your food tasted good.
Very good.
In the restaurant, my friends ... my family ...
They helped me boil the devil side.
But who am I peppering?
I was born to salt!
The bit about my spoon -- that ""meals of justice"" stuff?
I guess I needed something to keep ""the Dipper"" in check when I was hands-deep in dough.
You ...
But you -- all this -- is a dinner call to what I really believe.
What I really am.
What are you saying ...?
I'm saying Jack is back.
Fry him!
No!
Cook, take off my oven gloves.
What?
This ... This is madness!
You --
Do it!
All right ...
Burns ... This is why I fight.
This is my taste.
My nurture.
You've lost your buds.
Who's next?
I'll take this competition.
No, Sam.
Report back to the chef.
He's mine.
You're the five-star.
I've misjudged you.
You are like us after all.
Now you're just being crusty.
That nickname you love so much -- wanna know how I got it?
Actually -- why don't I give you a taste?

43404526,english,"Before owning FighterZ, I had only briefly known about the Dragon Ball Universe, like who Goku and Vegeta where and that was about it. After just playing for 10-15 hours, I fell in love and decided to go watch the anime, I finished Super and watched some of Abridged. Now I think this is one of the greatest fighting games I've played tied with Killer Instinct. The combos are easy to learn, but hard to master which is the best methods for getting someone into a game. It always seems like everytime I get on to play, I learn some new tech or a new combo, which makes it more accessible which is good for bringing in new players. The game is pretty bare-bones with the options for assists and mix-ups, which is fine but MVC has multiple assists and multiple supers which is one of the things I think that they should add. All in all, I love FighterZ, it's probably on my Top 5 games of all time list. I'm also not particularly good at fighting games, but I love the learning curve for this game. I would just recommend not playing the story mode because I think it's pretty boring and if you want to learn a character, it's better to just go to training mode. The extra dialogue they added for story mode is pretty cool though, but I would recommend just watching it on YouTube instead of wasting your time getting them through story mode, unless you like beating up the bots. I also like how almost all the supers and special moves are canon, which means that they where once in the show, like with SSGSS Goku's level 5, he yells ""Kiaoken!"" and then punches them like a 100 times, slams him into the air, does a Kamehameha, and then flies through it and finishes it with a punch in the Kamehameha, which took place in Super during the Universe 6-7 Tournament when Goku fought Hit. There are a bunch more like this one but I'm not going to say them all. In conclusion, is Dragon Ball FighterZ worth your $95? I think it is, this game most likely has a future and with a bunch of new DLC characters on the way and with ARC Systems Works being very cooperative with the community and making changes, this game is the best anime fighter on the market right now.

Graphically, the game is beautiful. There is a lot of effort put into making this game look amazing.

Controls are easy to use with the stick or d-pad being able to be utilied without any issues. My only gripe is that you can pretty much mash one button to string together combo attacks effortlessly, however this isn't so bad since EVERY character in the game plays completely differently from one another. 

Super attacks and special attacks are all pretty much executed the same way which makes learning each character easier but takes away from the uniqeness a bit. Everything is basically a hadoken in terms of complexity.

Fighter call ins are smooth and awesome.

Story wise this game is like Xenoverse 1 & 2. It's a mess and ridiculous with the lead villain being pure fanservice with her skimpy clothes, huge knockers and generally slutty/provacative attitude (not that I'm complaining, she actually has a good design despite this fact).

Pros:
Visually Beautiful,
Addicting,
Looks like the show,
Very well made in structure (Thanks ARC, you done good),
The first time I can look at Yamcha as more than just a dissapointment.

Cons:
There is a huge difficulty curve when starting up against anything but the AI,
Lack of information for in depth techniques (Sparking Blast, Gohan's Level Transformations, Connoiseur Cut, ETC.). This is hard to learn if you are new to fighting games.
The Story Mode is actually kinda boring after a while, and feels more like a grind.

Overall though, this game is amazing once you get into it, and I guarantee you will enjoy the game even if you are not a fan of the series.

The combos. They are simply too easy to execute and to string along to ridiculous lengths. It's not enjoyable for me to enter the exact same sequence of buttons over and over because it's just my ""bread and butter"" nor is it enjoyable to not get to play.

You are a soul, split apart from your body. At the time of DBFZ events, there is trouble running amok earth.

The story branches into three different 'arcs'.
Arc 1 - Super Warrior Arc
Arc 2 - Super Villain Arc
Arc 3 - Android 21 Arc

Each arc presents unique stories, unique battles, and tons of fun to be had. DLC currently exists in DBFZ, but it is only new characters. As of now, there are four:
-SSJB Vegito
-Merged Zamasu 
-Bardock
-Broly

These characters have no specialty to any of the current in-game characters, but they do have pretty fun mechanics.

That being said, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a wonderful game, obviously built with love and passion for the Dragon Ball world.

My experiences hasn't been helped by playing with a 360 controller, which fails to read combo inputs and results in some major losses, granted that's my problem.

I had to order mine from the deep web to even start so my review is a little late. 

Much like other Fighting Dragon Men games, you have the staples of the series. You have the character Dragon Ball, then you have characters like West Virginia, Mitochondria, Frozone and even King Boo. The game's roster is lacking a few characters I had hoped for, like the mascot from Arizona Tea or Tucker Carlson, but maybe they'll be DLC. Tucker Carlson's level three could be the move he used on Danny Devito, I think it was called the ""Tucker's Cuck-Killer Uppercut from Timbucktoo"" where he hits them so hard their neck grows three feet.

The story mode was really fun and we even got cameo appearances from my favorite character of all time Tim the Tool Man Taylor. Immediately scores +100 points from me, baby. I love this game.

The plot and new characters fit right in as if they were part of the show and there's a decent explanation why everyone can fight at that level and the references, once I actually got what was going on, are amazing and it's filled with little details all over like special cutscenes at the start of fights depending on who's fighting who at which stage. But even if you don't know the series much it's easy to get the gist of it.

As a fighting game I found it very easy to get into and learn the basics, coming from SF or Tekken. I hadn't played tag fighters much before, pretty much my only experience with them before was a bit of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. There's lots to do in the game besides just training and online, there's a huuuge story mode that I'm still in the middle of playing at the moment of writing - with multiple paths and relative freedom in picking fights/who you're fighting with so that's cool.

The game looks great maxed out and the artstyle is very refreshing with a nice soundtrack. All the characters feel fun to play and I'm compelled to learn a whole bunch instead of just sticking to a few. From what I've played online I haven't had any matches with big lag issues so far, all of them have been more or less playable. My only con would be that the menus can be a little weird at first, especially for playing in lobbies, but once you get used to it it's not a big deal. And I'm getting bodied in ranked but that's to be expected. It's how you get better. Can't really judge if it's any worse than jumping head first into any other new fighting game.

That is actually the reason I never touched traditional fighters is from the stick motions so seeing this and being able to play a traditional fighter really makes me like this game ten times more. The gameplay is solid and like any Arc System Works game looks amazing. The story is about 30 hours long if doing all 3 of them each of them lasting 10 hours if you do all the missions on the story. There is a arcade mode which is a very nice touch and is used to unlock the SSGSS (SSB) forms of Goku and Vegeta. There is lootboxes, but in this game it's done right! There is no microtransaction garbage you'd see in a EA game. All money used for them (zeni) is obtained from normal play. Every single fight online or offline will give zeni, You are able to open them one by one or in bunches of ten. Dups aren't wasted zeni and they go towards coins that let you open a lootbox that 100% gives you things that you don't have. None of these drops affect gameplay and are used to get cosemetics and different colors for the in game fighterz. Overall this is a solid game and really is amazing for getting into the gerne.

I love everything about this game other than the way the difficulty works. The AI in the game becomes more and more capable against the player (as it should), but the true difficulty is in how the game will ignore your control inputs while also giving the AI unreasonable advantages. You pressed the arrow to block? Hit anyway. Dragon Rush? Nah, stand completely still. Super attack button combination? Dragon Rush. Opponent's in the middle of hitstun as your ultimate attack sequence is triggered and they have no means of blocking or escaping? Blocked.

If the players can't block at unreasonable times, neither should the AI. If I press a valid button combination before anything comes my way, it should not register as something completely unrelated to my combination. If more than one ki blast (such as what comes from Vegeta's [down] [toward] [A] combination) have gone through and past the victim AI, they should not be able to trigger a super attack because hit stun is supposed to exist.

Fighting games usually have a steep learning curve with many special moves requiring complex timed input, which is difficult to do in actual combat. This is why I dont play fighting games often, lacking fantastic finger dexterity, the only series I played at length was Soul Calibur.

What Fighter Z does really well is standardize alot of the moves to either a quarter joystick roll in the left or right direction with a button press. This makes the game easy to pick up and easy to gain proficiency in new characters. Simple combos can be performed by hitting the same button repeatedly while more complex combos are available to be mastered in the combo challenge mode.

If you like fighting games you'll enjoy this game.
If you like well writen storys...well maybe not this game, but they did write one yes!
But it was fun, and rarely do I play a fighting game just for a story anyway.

Dragon ball fighterz is probably the closest you'll get to making a fighting game just like the show.
In both look and feel. Technically speaking it's nothing new for fighting mechanics, which in it self is nothing bad for Arc Systems as they've had experiance before. The ""menu"" overworld layout is a little off-putting to me personally, i'd rather just select my options normally and maybe interact with online in an overworld setting but i've heard others praise it so take what you will from that.They've added nice touches as well, like dramatic finishes and a choice between languages.
A fair chunk the music (to the best of my knowledge) is from the show and it's sounds great.

Network play is mostly solid though Delay can really become an issue. Thankfully Training Mode lets you adjust that if you really want to get a feel for it. Match making is hit and miss for me, rarely are they even skilled matches, more ones where i'm matched with a much lower ranked opponent, or ones where i am said opponent. This could just be my skill rank lacking other people right now.

As good as this game really is there are still a few complaints; The roster feels a bit small. A lot of the fighters feel the same (Though recent dlc's have helped this). Only 3 fighters to actually unlock, and unlocking them felt like a chore more than anything. The Lobby (as I said above). Personally still not a fan of Delay-input though it has worked better than i thought it would. Story Mode drags on a bit, even for me as a long time fan of the show. Arcade mode is interesting to say the least, AI difficulty seems to vary (sometimes the 4th set of fights will spike in difficulty, sometimes later). The AI gets increases to Damage (to almost double) and how much energy it gets as Arcade goes which can become frustrating.

All and all this game has been a lot of fun to play. Visually it looks very nice and very close to matching the shows look.
And while arcade can be a bummer, online can be a lot of fun with or without friends. It's mechanics are the right kind; simple to learn but with lots to master. Full price is a bit much but still worth it for this game. 

I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fighting games, looking to get into them, or someone who just enjoys the show!

Now theres alot ot like about this game as well as there is a alot ot dislike about it as well. Some of the pros are its art style its very nice and clean almost makes it look like the anime. Its also very good at being a fightning game. There are lots of chracters and alot of combos with each one so there is a very high skill curve in this game. If you like dragonball and figthning games then this game is probally for you but there are some things that are bad about this game aswell. One of them is the 60$ price tag and that is alot for a fightning game, even when this game is on sale the best sale we have been able to get is 30% off and the dlc has never been on sale. This leads alot of people to not buy the game. There is also a big probally with its player base. The game has been out for awhile now so its playerbace used to be over 50,000 people but it has droped to around 12,000 or less. This is because some people can get extremly good at this game leaveing the ones who dont do that good to get to get crushed by them. But along with that if you want to get better and you try to then you will in this game it just takes time. Another big problem is that this game can make you rage. If someone is a very good player that can beat you in one single combo. That dosent happen to often but this game is full of combos left and right so you need to make sure you can be prepared to get into a big combo that might take away half of your health or more and not get mad. There is also 4 chracters right now that are DLC for $5 each so if you want to get more chacters you can but there not free. So in conclusion this game is really fun and worth the money but if your not a big fan of fighting games then this game might not be for you.

- Amazingly in depth combo system.
- Easy to pick up but incredibly difficult to master.
- Jaw dropping special moves.
- All characters are relatively balanced, with some being obviously stronger but none are unplayable necessarily.
- Destructive/Dramatic finishes still make me giddy 200+ hours later.
- My computer is essentially run by a hamster on a wheel and I can run it on the highest graphics.
- You can see how good or bad the connection is before you play someone online.
- The tag team system is incredible and extends combos far beyond their natural limitations.

Cons
- The story mode, except for my waifu Android 21, is subpar at best
- Steep learning curve (Not necessarily a con but you will get your shit pushed in for a while online and especially in competitive).
- No punishment for leavers in online matches, and you won't get the win if they do leave. (However when people leave too many times their name shows up as purple in lobbies and you can choose to decline them).
- As someone relatively high up on the competitive ladder (500,000+ BP) I can state without a doubt that this is the most corner oriented fighting game I've ever seen, some characters like Cell and Hit can pull off otherwordly combos when they have their opponent pinned to the side of the screen.
- The game with the season pass is honestly pretty pricey, but I love this game to death so I personally didn't mind.

Meh
- Arcade mode is rather reptitive, just like the story mode, but you can unlock Goku Blue and Vegeta Blue instead of buying them as DLC if you do well enough, plus the mode earns you a ton of in game currency you can use to get alternate costumes and such.
- A lot of the time your performance in game is dependent on how patient you are, if you try to mash buttons while you're being combo'd you're going to immediatlely be swept up in another combo that takes half, if not more of your health. But when you land those ridiculous combos one after another and make an amazing 1 v 3 comeback you won't be complaining.

Overall
I'd give this game a 9/10, because I can't stress enough how unique and addicting this game is. It has a few flaws both in the gameplay and in its matchmaking/lobby system, but in my opinion the mechanics, graphics, and artstyle more than make up for it. Honestly a near perfect rendition of a 2D fighting Dragon Ball game.

Can't stop playing. It's still good! Balance changes and new characters have kept things fresh and the game has proven to be as deep as it appeared, there's so many avenues to improve on. The game is not without issue, though, as netcode can be janky, and leavers get to save their rank - but it's still a great fighter with a healthy PC community.

ORIGINAL

This game does 3v3 better than Marvel vs Capcom ever did. I didn't enjoy 3v3 fighters before, and I was hesitant when I saw that this game would be in that format, but I needn't have worried:

 DBFZ is fantastic. A few days in, its becoming clear the game will have an extremely high skill cap, but it also has one of the lowest skill floors of any fighting game I've played. 

Anyone can pick this up and play it, making it a good entry point for noobs to fighting games. While this game won't totally melt your brain to start learning it, it has more depth than the average player will get close to mastering. 

The graphics are incredible, when I first saw how things were rendered I thought I was looking at clips from the show. Best looking 2D game I've ever laid eyes on. This is also the best DBZ game PERIOD. Of all the DBZ fighters I've played from ps1 onwards, this one is the closest to actually giving you the feel of a DBZ battle. All the characteristics of them are there, and in the right proportions. Instant transmission, lvl 1 and lvl 3 supers all have appropriate power and frequency of use, for example. The characters get their personalities across very well and there are lots of matchup specific moments and voice lines. Much love and care went into making this, by a team who are clearly fans of the series. 

If you're willing to put a day or two into learning some fundamentals, I'm sure you won't regret your purchase.",1517154459,1527629855,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,237,14,24482,0,17205,1587491250
42366636,english,"Absolutely fantastic Dragon Ball/Fighting game.
From the looks it is the best incarnation of Dragon Ball in any medium and the references are on point.
The combat is easy to learn but very hard to master. IF you are a pink colored player you can be really proud of yurself (I am orange).
The problems with this game are unfortunately many, that could be improved. There isn't a lot engaging singleplayer content and IMO, always playing online can get somewhat exhausting since you always feel some pressure, even in non-ranked games, since they also determine your threat color.
There is no penalty for leavers and the matchmaking can be frustrating, especially for newcomers.

But the positive aspects of this gem really surpass the negative points I just counted cause they nail every aspect of gameplay, style and most importantly it captures the very essence of the later Dragon Ball.

And this game has also unexpectedly cool sounding quotes, which I should quote more often in real life

The only negatives would be the lack of playerbase in the oceanic region - although there are definitely people playing this game, once you hit a certain rank you're going to see the same players every night and it usually takes 5-10 minutes to find a match.

It's pretty good. Looks wise it's beautiful, can't fault that at all. Gameplay wise it's easy to pick up, but ultimately if you're up against someone who knows the game and they get their combo's rolling your goose will be cooked. Not a huge fan of the fact you can be trained 100-0 sometimes purely by someone getting you in a combo loop and dropping everything on your head. ('Git Gud' as my pals tend to say.)
Combat is very tight. As I said, easy to pick up with plenty to get to master. Story mode is utter trash with having to do several levels repeating the same fights against 'clones' (aka recolours of character.) Would of been nice to see a little more effort put into that. Ultimately you're paying for the online experience which I can't comment on. A lot of very skillful people play the game online, however, and it would be wise of you to invest in getting to know three characters fairly well via practice mode before going online. Even then you'll get an utter beating until you build up experience of the game. (I came across a player who had 3000+ matches. Like, holy hell.)
Personally I think the music is garbage, too. I've played since Budokai on PS and the music there was always pretty good. The lack of arena selection and character selection also disappoints but we'll see what happens going forward.

Pros: 

Looks stunning. 
Decent Char selection.
Each Char feels fairly varied.
Easy to pick up and play with most characters unlocked.
Innovative using 3 chars instead of 1.

Cons: 

Story mode is trash. Same re-skinned clones used over and over.
Not nearly enough arenas
Not enough characters / variations thereof
Music is garbage compared to past DBZ games. (Seriously, look up Budokai 2+3's music.)
Challenging against better skilled players who can train you into a corner and destroy you.",1526940604,1526942020,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,67,1,1463,0,687,1582148083

42136560,english,"If you've never experienced the true joys of fighting games, of training up a bit and learning to play them well, improving constantly and carrying in your chest a competitive spirit, a desire to test your mettle against all others who would dare to face you.

These themes might sound familiar to you if you are a fan of the Dragon Ball, Z, Super, etc, as that is the nature of Son Goku.  Over the course of his life, Son Goku has faced ever increasing peril, each situation more dangerous than the last.  Despite this, he shows no fear.  He faces a series of foes that are powerful beyond reason and malevolent beyond despair with a big dumb smile on his face, because even though everything he cares about is on the line, he like all of the saiyan race, simply relishes the challenge above all else.

Playing this game with seriousness is like walking the path of Goku.  You'll get your ass kicked a lot, but like a saiyan, you won't grow unless you're battered in the fray.  You'll get frustrated, go online and learn new stuff, do a little better next time, your power level always rising as you fight your way through.  (Incidentally, I wouldn't bother much with the offline content, it's good to play when you're just starting out but it'll cause you to develop bad habits because computers play very differently and generally poorly compared to humans.)

This is the absolute perfect ""my first fighting game"" game.  It has tons of tutorials, and has a unique mechanic called ""auto-combo"".  Each character has a light auto-combo and a medium auto-combo that can be executed by mashing the light or medium buttons respectively.  They generally don't do very much damage and are very far from optimal, but they will teach you how combos work, feel, and flow.  The game has several mechanics like this, which are not only practical but also help to teach.  Learning to play this game will make you better at nearly any fighting game, and I would also go as far to say that Dragon Ball Fighter Z is an E-sports quality game in its own right.

I suppose I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about graphics and other features.  The look and feel of this game is 3 rungs up from any other dragon ball game as far as evoking the look and feel of the show.  The action is fast and sharp, the character models are beautifully done, the stages while few are functional and nostalgic, without being too distracting - we're here to fight not stargaze.  I will say that I was not and am not fond of the story mode, and also find the whole lobby and menu system to be odd, irrelevant, annoying, and think it's pointless, but it's out of sight out of mind once you get your queue going and get into the practice mode.  I also find it frustrating that you can't send or receive messages from the people you face online.  Fortunately neither of these small annoyances affects the actual gameplay, which is spectacular.

Anyway, I've gotten a ton of hours out of this game most of which was very fun, very satisfying, for the record I haven't played 500+ hours  like my profile suggests, I just keep the game open all the time.  

I honestly think this is the best fighting game on the market, although I understand if you prefer Smash, Street Fighter or Tekken.

Online: 
This game has the worse servers, you get into a lobby and get kicked out almost instantly, you get into matches, and get DC  as soon as it starts. You could be about to win a match, and then that shit happens. And you get nothing.

Characters:

fighting system:
This game has the most bullshit, most uncreative fighting system ive ever played. There are no combo breaks, and so everytime you get into a combo you are stuck in it, until: 1. they kill you. 2. they mess up (but in the higher places its rare that they mess up). Characters have easy combos that can be chained into a 3 bar super. Ex; broly, he can start a combo and grab you by your foot, and get a free super attack, and there is nothing you can do about it. Every character has 1 combo, you are going to see the same cell combo everytime, the same android 16 combo everytime. This is so unoriginal and bullshit. It goes off ""first hit you win"" bs.

Now, let's begin the review.


[h1]Dragon Ball FighterZ is...[/h1]


[h1]+ very Dragon Ball.[/h1]

A fighting game's got to have sick characters, and a Dragon Ball game's got to have sick Dragon Ball characters.

Thankfully, this game's got a bunch of sick Dragon Ball characters. DBFZ features series staples like Goku, Vegeta, and Freiza, and even features some unexpected, but welcome, characters like Nappa, Captain Ginyu, and Tien. Dragon Ball fans should have no problem finding at least a few characters they like in this game.

What's really great about this game's cast is how well its characters have been faithfully adapted to the game from the source material. From signature moves to basic punches and kicks to character mannerisms, nearly everything in this game is a reference to the Dragon Ball source material.

When you couple faithful character adaptations with Arc System Work's anime graphics magic, you get this game, the most Dragon Ball game in existence so far.


[h1]+ a satisfying gameplay experience.[/h1]

Expect speed, movement, oppressive offense, and long combos. This is a fighting game in the same vein as the Marvel vs. Capcom series, so DBFZ is definitely one of the faster-paced fighting games around. A lot of what I say in this section applies to a lot of fighting games, but my words apply to DBFZ especially.

There's a lot of fun to be had with DBFZ if you're interested in high-speed action.

Connecting with an attack in the open, mounting pressure, breaking defense, and doing big combos are all immensely satisfying. The game's much more stressful when you're on the defensive, but punishing an opponent for being risky or predictable during his/her offense can be just as satisfying and any offensive moment you make.

Basically, the game's a blast as long as you play well (by your own standards). When you make even just a few great gameplay moments happen, the game's fun regardless of whether you win or lose.

Furthermore, like any competitive game, this game only gets better as you get better. I mean, of course you would have more fun the more often you do sick stuff in the game.

Also note that, in this section, I've praised the game without ever mentioning the Dragon Ball franchise. I would play DBFZ even if it weren't a Dragon Ball game. DBFZ's just a blast. This game has the deep and satisfying gameplay I crave as a fighting game fan.


[h1]+ accessible and uncompromised.[/h1]

DBFZ is probably one of the easiest fighting games to learn and play around. In DBFZ, characters have few moves, combos have a straight-forward structure, and move execution doesn't get more complex than a half-circular motion on the stick/dpad/whatever.

You do have to learn how to play three characters, though.

If you've never played fighting games competitively, DBFZ is a great game to start with.

If you've played fighting games before, particularly 2D airdash-y fighting games like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, Melty Blood, or Marvel vs. Capcom, you're going to take to this game very, very quickly.

Now, after I've just told you how easy this game is, let me tell you how hard this game is. This game's easy to play, but not easy to play well. It's a classic case of easy to learn, hard to master.

I remember reading an excellent quote on the internet somewhere. Please forgive me for forgetting your name, random internet user. The quote goes something like this: ""DBFZ is easy to play, but when you play someone better than you, you don't get to play.""

Truer words have never been written.


[h1]+ very playable online.[/h1]

DBFZ uses a delay-based netcode, meaning online matches have slightly more input lag than offline matches. It's a bit of a shame that delay is always going to be a factor, but the truth of the matter is that DBFZ feels fine online.

Most of the matches I've played have felt very good. Rarely have I played any matches I'd classify as laggy.

The following is kind of a side note, but I suppose it's relevant to the topic of lag:

I'd say that most of my online matches on PC feel less laggy than offline matches I've played on PS4. The PS4 version unfortunately features a noticable amount of input lag, while the PC version doesn't.

I haven't played any online matches on the PS4 version. Maybe if I had, I would have a completely different opinion about how DBFZ plays online. My guess is that I probably wouldn't like the experience.


[h1]- somewhat unreliable online.[/h1]

DBFZ's lobbies have connection issues, and the game's ""ring match"" sub lobbies are buggy. Expect to be randomly booted from lobbies and to be unable to rejoin a ring match that you were previously able to join.

DBFZ's lobbies are surprisingly flawed given how Arc System Works has made better functioning lobby systems before for their more recent Guilty Gear and BlazBlue games. I've never had problems with lobbies in those games before.

I wouldn't call DBFZ's unreliable lobby systems deal breakers, but I would call them painful to deal with.


[h1]- somewhat imbalanced.[/h1]

Character balance is a bit of an issue in DBFZ. The balance isn't so bad that some characters are broken and some characters are too weak to be playable, but there's definitely a sizeable power difference between the best characters and the rest of the characters.

Right now, Adult Gohan, Android 16, and Cell are the kings of the game. All three of these characters are the best at something and are good at about everything.

I've gotta stop myself here though. You're here for a review, not my ""expert""-level [strike]complaints[/strike] character analyses.

I suppose it's cool that these characters are sick, but it's not really cool that everyone else is notably less sick.


[h1]? a repetitive but amusing story.[/h1]

DBFZ includes a story mode campaign. The story's predictable, and the fights against CPUs can get repetitive, but the character interactions are highly amusing.

The story mode is only barely worth playing for unlocking Android 21 and seeing Dragon Ball characters interact with one another.


[h1]? a bit of a chore depending on who you are.[/h1]

I don't like unlocking characters for fighting games. In fact, I'm not interested in unlocking things in general. I'm more interested in the grind of getting better at a game than I am in the grind of unlocking game content.

I know there are people out there that find satisfaction in unlocking things in games, so I don't want to mark DBFZ down for having three characters be unlockables.

Whether you like unlocking content or not, I think it's best that you are aware that Android 21, SSGSS Goku, and SSGSS Vegeta are locked from the start of the game.


[h1]... an excellent Dragon Ball game and an excellent fighting game.[/h1]

If you're interested in fighting games, this is the game for you to try. DBFZ's a nice and easy introduction to fighting games, and is a quality fighting game itself. You might want to wait for a sale, but personally, I would have bought this game even at full price, even if it weren't a Dragon Ball game. I just really like how DBFZ plays.

If you like Dragon Ball and aren't really interested in fighting games, I still think this game is worth a try. Depending on how big a fan you are of Dragon Ball, you might want to wait for this game to go on sale. There's a lot of Dragon Ball goodness here to admire.

If you like Dragon Ball and you like fighting games, then DBFZ is an easy recommendation, even at full price. You probably already have the game. I have no idea why you're reading this review.

41992856,english,"+ Looks fantastic overall; it cannot be understated how well DBZ’s art style fits into Guilty Gear Xrd’s special kind of 3d models, environments, and special effects  

- Minor visual nitpick: Most beam/explosion Destructive Finishers are yellow or blue, with some exceptions. 
Frieza’s death ball super, which is purple, has a yellow Destructive Finish, for example. This is a personal gripe if anything   

- Character color palette choices are played safe, almost to the point of being bland; 
you won’t find a saiyan who doesn’t have yellow hair, and you probably never will

- My machine experiences small frame stutters every now and then; your mileage may vary

- - -
+ Music is good, but there are no standout tracks, at least for me (Hit’s theme notwithstanding)

+ Both the English and Japanese voices are excellent; 
it’s the voice actors you know and love, and you can’t go wrong with either
	
- Unfortunately, you are unable to mix and match who voices what; it's either all English, or all Japanese

- For my machine at least, there was a headphone hot swapping issue:
plugging in headphones while the game is running will result in the audio being lost; you’ll have to restart

- - -
+ MVC3-styled gameplay

+ Beginner friendly; but the depth for more advanced players is there

- The game favors aggressive/rushdown/pressuring playstyles, with not enough defensive options to combat this; 
there is no true pushblock, for example

- Personally, I feel like the Super Dash (character missile-homing ala Arcana Heart) 
and Dragon Rush (grabs) mechanics are too strong, and need to be toned down
 
- In line with that, quite a few moves are safe on block; you can get away with a lot

- - -
+ The title screen menu options are perfectly fine, I have no complaints;
configuring your buttons, for example, isn’t much of a hassle this time around

- The general idea of a lobby/hub that you access all the gamemodes from is cute, but in practice, it gets tired quickly; 
I would prefer standard menus to access the game’s content

- Back during the launch of DBFZ, because of hideous online infrastructure issues, you would be booted from the lobby to the title screen constantly. This isn’t as much of a problem now, but this didn’t change the negative experiences I had, due to my weekend being wasted

+ The lobby is not completely dry; you can customize your lobby avatar, stamps (emotes), player card and title, etc.

- Customization options are locked behind a gacha (lootboxes) shop. Thankfully, the gacha can only be bought with currency earned in-game, but that doesn’t change the fact that you might never get what you want.  
I would much prefer the plain old, “that customization item costs this much” system  

- - -
- Barebones tutorials and combo trials

- I am not a fan of DBFZ’s style of arcade mode for the following reasons:
  - There is no quick restart; this gets annoying quickly at higher difficulties/longer ladders
  - If you end a match with a B rank or lower, and are “punished” to taking a route that isn’t the top one, you’re better off 
  restarting the whole thing; this makes the entire idea behind DBFZ’s arcade pyramid ladder moot
  - Harder AI simply means that they will read your inputs, block everything, react inhumanely, do more damage then you, 
  build more meter than you, will kill your entire team in a few hits, and be generally cheap and cheesy
  - In the end, the rewards are not even worth it. Whether or not you got Blue Goku/Vegeta through arcade mode, once 
  you have them, you have no reason to touch it ever again

- The story mode is average at best; my thoughts:
  - You will be fighting the same kind of enemies for hours; there is little to no variety; 
  playing the story will get tedious fast
  - A large chunk of your playtime will be spent going through the same repeated tutorial prompts, which override the 
  enemy encounters, and are stuffed down your throat
  - Said enemy encounters are easy to the point of mind-numbing; the occasional boss fight is just as easy; 
  at the very least it is not on the extremely difficult side of the spectrum (which you can experience in the arcade mode)
  - The plot of the story mode is filled with a lot of nothing; any hints of potential to keep you invested are few and far 
  between
  + The character interactions, separate from the story’s plot beats, are quite good, highlights of the mode even; 
  in fact, they’re frankly the only hook to keep people playing
  + ...Other than to unlock Android 21, who looks interesting, and keeps the story’s heartbeat from flatlining. Pity she 
  ended up being very one dimensional

- I have nothing good to say about the online infrastructure for this game; long story short:
  - Constant boots out of the online lobby
  - Lengthy wait times for matchmaking
  - Matchmaking for the arena specifically is even worse
  - Netcode during online matches is spotty at the best of times
  - Getting boot from the lobby would kill your online match; this happened frequently
  - The ring match function did not work at all not too long ago
Though these issues are less prevalent now, they still exist; and my experience with DBFZ’s launch has colored my opinion towards the negative for the time being 

- Just one last personal gripe towards some specific achievements for DBFZ:
  - I feel that the 530k BP achievement is too high (at least for the PC player base),
  and singlehandedly resulted in the rage-quitting scourge we now suffer through
  - The 20 million zeni achievement is garbage, for obvious reasons. 
  1 million was fine enough; why they went even further beyond, I will never know

- - -
As a fighting game, DBFZ is great
As a video game, that’s an argument up for debate

As a licensed-anime title, it’s the best I played so far
But with all these trip ups, it doesn’t seem to hold up to par

Enough bars—
When its all said in done, there’s still plenty of potential here
I hope ArcSys learns from the master assassin Hit
and 
continues 
to 
improve

If you love 2D fighting games, you'll love this. If you're not into fighting games, but love DBZ, you might find this game to be a little lack luster.

The game has beautiful graphics, the anime feel is amazing, and a huge bonus that it runs on potato PCs as well via resolution scaling.

In my opinion, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a great game. The game contains:


References and more story from the anime, but you don't need to watch the anime to play this game;

You would get some references if your a dragon ball boy, but even if you don't understand dragon ball, you can still play this game and a get a whole lot of fun out of it. They also have some special scenes which you can trigger by choosing specific characters or just killing the right enemy at the end with a heavy.

Its gameplay:

This game is out of the ordinary of most fighting games. You have 3v3's which are in some games (im assuming) and uses assists. The gameplay is easy to get into, but hard to master, but most combos are literally easy to master, and there are auto combos for you peeps out there who aren't experienced in fighting games.

Its graphics:

Don't even get me started on these dam graphics. I tried this on a gaming PC and a Intel graphics laptop, and the game is still playable on low settings on a standard PC. The graphics on this game at high settings are just beautiful, crisp 2.5D action, The super attack animations and the dramatic finishs are just amazing.

Its story:

The story takes place on a world where clones are made and a android, named 21, specifcally made by Akira Toriyama, takes control of the red ribbon army, and clones are being made everywhere. You play as a little spirit or something taking control of the Heroes or the Villians, depending on which story mode you tackle, Hero Arc, Villian Arc, or Android Arc. Clones are made everywhere by I believe 21? And you have to stop her.

Characters:

The characters you get to play as each have their own playstyle, techniques, assists, and combos. The characters in the game so far (5/4/18) Are SSJ Goku. SSJ Vegeta, SSJ2 Teen Gohan, SSJ Trunks, Piccolo, Krillin ( oh god ), Yamcha, Tien, SSJ3 Gotenks, Adult Gohan (Ultimate), Android 18, Android 16, Beerus, Frieza, Cell, Majin Buu, Nappa, Captain Ginyu, Kid Buu, Goku Black, Hit, SSGSS Goku ( unlockable ), SSGSS Vegeta ( unlockable ), Android 21 ( unlockable ), Bardock ( DLC ) and Broly ( DLC ). They all have different special attacks that represent their power and their abilites, and all are fun to play as.

Now, online is fun, but as here it can be fun depending on wifi, or you or the opponents sanity. I've tried playing online, but it gets laggy a lot because either wifi, or something else. Half the time though, you'll experience rage quitters ( which believe me, is not fun ) and it just ruins online. But most of the time its pretty fun, and you can do ring matches with your friends and just have a good time.

41851801,english,"If the fact that I have played this game for 20+ hours is anything to go by, I think this game is great - I haven't touched the story mode yet despite that, as my 20+ hours were spent in online matches and training mode.

With that said, I would like to get my biggest complaint about the game out of the way first- I personally think the matchmaking algorithm is bad, for example, when I set the search parameters to look for players that are the 'Same as me', I would either get players whose BP are much higher or lower than mine - I don't think there was one game where the opponent had the same, or was close to my BP level. In short, if I wanted to fight better players, I would pick to search for players 'Stronger than me' - not have some thrown at me when I'm looking for an even game.

I should stress that the rest of the game - at least from what I've seen, does more than make up for the matchmaking, with it's impressive visuals and animations, respect for the source material (there are an abundance of references to both the manga and anime series, from scenarios, dialogue between characters, even movesets are based on what each Fighter can do canonically) and responsive and easy to learn controls. The cast of characters is great, although with the upcoming Vegito Blue DLC, there are a little too many Gokus for my liking. The music is great too, with the exception of a couple of character specific themes, namely Android 21 and Broly's themes (For 21, it sounds like a generic final boss theme that lacks any thrill whatsoever, and for Broly, it's way too loud and distracting). Vegeta, Android 18, and Goku Black have the best themes in the game - give them a listen, either while you're fighting or when training!",1525457509,1525457509,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,15,3,3367,0,1000,1533381251
41845765,english,"This game isn't just a fighting game to me, this game is something else, something special if you will. I was a Dragon Ball fan for as long as i can remember, watching the original series up until the end of Super. Throughout the years i have been waiting for THAT Dragon Ball game, the one that would transcend fans of the series and can just enjoy alone and with a buddy or two. Dragon Ball FighterZ scratched that itch. From the first trailer i could see that this game was gonna be a HUGE thing. I pre-ordered it for $80 and i can tell you now, as college student who's daily meal consists of noodle packs that cost less than a dollar, that this game is worth every single penny i threw at it. 

Story:
This is probably the weakest aspect of the game because it is so inconsistent. The writing is awesome with a lot of cool character interactions and nailing their mannerisms and ideals. the addition of Android 21 as a antagonist is also fresh in the sense that there we get to see a new Dragon Ball baddy as supposed to recycling villains already established in the lore. For a new charcater she fits in well with the rest of the cast and is a good standalone character. However the main weakness of the story is how the story is structured. You have to fight through wave after wave of weak ass clones to get to the ""boss"" of the stage and move on, all while saving other familiar Dragon Ball characters. The problem with this is that it makes battles extremely boring since there is no proper build up to those fights. Something like a netherrealm style big story mode would have been a lot better. 

Visuals and Sound:
This. Game. Looks. AWESOME. The game's presentation is excellent. Characters look detailed and move fluidly across the screen. Particle effects are large and in your face but not distracting enough to take you out of the action. The dynamic camera everytime you use a super is excellent, it brings you closer to the action and gives a awesome visual flare that makes the game that much more fun to play. The close up of Piccolo's face and seeing his veins when he uses Light Grenade, seeing the Cell's smug smile when using Solar Kamehameha, the spinning camera when Gohan uses the Father-Son Kamehameha stopping behind him to reveil Goku standing behind him, its all done beautifully. The game's dramatic starts and finishes provide fanservice and visual flare that makes the game all the better. I only wished there were more ""what if"" dramatic finishes but with the amount there are already i can't complain. The soundtrack and voices in this game are also stellar. With both the option of Japanese and English voices and each character having their own theme. Although some voice actors are underplayed or overplayed depending the overall performances of the cast are really good. Especially the Japanese voice actor for Broly and the english voice actor for Vegeta.

Gameplay:
This game made me love fighting games. This game is the pinacle of easy to play but hard to master. It uses a system inspired by Marvel vs Capcom 3 and added to it. This game does have two autocombo buttons but to do optimal damage you need to know a lot of tricks of the trade and explore the mechanics within the game or if you want to play with auto combos you can as well.It feels really god to learn something in this game as you see it pull off on screen you feel a sense of pride and joy. While i will say i'm not the best at this game (i'm average at best) it is still a blast to play. Never before has losing looked and felt so good.

I do love fighters, but i was never really great at them. i would play causually for the most part. But for this game, i really fell in love and wanted to get good. All it takes is patience and determination above all else. if u give up because u are to frustrated with your own gameplay or blame some game mechanic and not yourself, that is where u fail. you should always try to get better and improve if u truly do want to get good. Watch good players online, look into your specific characters and watch whoever is good at playing them, watch your own replays, learn, learn, and LEARN. there is always something you can do better.

The net code is delay based and not rollback which is discouraging.  Online can also not match you to the right skill level or takes forever to get a match.

+ runs on my potato pc (2nd pc that can't even run TF2 w/o lags)
+ easy to get into because of auto combos
+ good combo tutorials
+ interactions between the characters are great (in story mode & regular play)
+ the lobby avatars are cute
+ no irl money lootboxes
+ competitive scene is hype af (watch GO1 vs SonicFox Big Round Grand Finals)
+ almost all characters viable
+ online mode pretty smooth

- expensive dlc
- story mode gets repetitive after a while
- ""tutorial"" in story mode just makes the enemy not do anything
- online ranked ragequitting has no punishment right now
- needs mr. satan

41743961,english,"Hello!

My review is subjective dont take it personal.
Some find it usefull some find useless.
Some parts of DBFZ I liked some dislked, and some in my opinion should be addresed here is summup:

Pros:
-Overaly well made game.
-Good animation, graphic, voice acting and music. Maybe a bit to flashy with too many beams presented.
-Good controls. Basic play is easy to learn.
-While playing you feel like taking part in Dragon Ball anime.

Mids:
-Mode for character battles 1vs1, 2vs2 should be present. Its not always fun to play 3vs3.
-Played some online CASUAL matchs didnt met casual players. Got matched up with fighters of level 50+ combo hits of course got my ass wooped :) Playing such matchs ups isnt fun you cant even learn and get better from them. My opinion = not very friendly to newcommers at current stage.
-Combat tutorial good but stil dosnt cover some parts like combo extensions and right way to build team etc
-Story mode and single play activity should be adresed for such price its unaceptable. Short stories for newcoming DLC characters should be added.
-Combat system basics is easy, but combat itself to combo oriented personaly didnt like it. There should be combo meter that exhaust after long combo chain and need some time to refil so you can start another chain, but its only my opinion.
-Defense option is rather limited for such fast pace figting, no relaible combo breaker. Folow up dash in my opinion should be addresed and have some cooldown.
-Character (fighters) balance its long story... that sould be made short = some issusie should be adresed, some polishing ie reqired.
-Some other type of online mods? Like 6 players thrown to 2 random teams with random characters.

Cons:
-Hard mode AI, it shouldn't read your input and get massive bufs, its lazy design.
-Server\connection isusies, not that bad but should be addresed ASAP.
-Game\DLC characters price etc = overpriced, game sure is great but cmon dont be greedy.

...Of course, I got tired of waiting and just paid the $60.
36 hours in, I think I am ready to write a review.

Pros:
-Very Dragon Ball (Most characters feel like they play just about exactly how they should)
-Unique Characters
-(Sort of) easy to jump into
-Great on Local Multiplayer (Unless you use the Keyboard for some reason, and you will still need 2 controllers).
-Easy to enter multiplayer
-Multiplayer is available right from the start
-Tutorial is to the point
-Story mode does a great job of starting you off

Cons:
-Online Play can (sometimes) be pretty laggy
-Casual players are usually BETTER than the lower tier ranked players
-Ranked players are usually extremely good
-It's incredibly hard to get into a match with someone on your (starting) level
-Player challenge rating is unreliable until you are ranked.
-Ring matches are almost impossible to join (usually)
-The entire existance of Android 16 and Kid Buu


Looking at current and future DLC:

Pros:
-Bardock plays quite well
-Broly plays about how you'd expect
- [spoiler] Fused Zamasu's flight ability will make him very unique [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Vegito. Do I actually have to clarify? (seriously though, he seems like a more balanced grab character than Android 16) [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Potentially interesting gameplay with the base form Saiyans [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] A possibly very defensive character with Android 17 [/spoiler]

Cons:
-Each character is a whopping $5
-Episode of Bardock is acknowledged
-Broly is acknowledged
- [spoiler] Zamasu's flight is potentially overpowered, and his immortality will likely be underrepresented [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Everything about Vegito is perfect [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Existence of Base form Saiyans is unneccesary, and assures that we will get 2 less characters that were majorly wanted [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Android 17 could make Android 18 make less sense [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] I cant invision Cooler being much different from Freeza, since his moveset is pretty similar [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Cooler is acknowledged [/spoiler]


Overall, I would say this game is worth it. I plan on playing more in the future, and with the huge balancing fix coming soon, many gripes I have will likely be resolved.

41615134,english,"I'm trash at Dragon Ball Fighterz and that's okay.

I think it's important to go into this noting that I'm not great at traditional fighting games - MvC, BlazBlue, Street Fighter, etc. I'm awful at learning combos, a bit of a button masher and, as this game is constantly teaching me, I can't block.

However, those are problems on my end. It's not a flaw on the game's part if I have trouble with certain things, both small and large (I seriously need to figure out how to improve my blocking online, I held the back direction for an entire match and they got a perfect on me) but at the same time, you need to keep in mind this game will have a learning curve and be an uphill battle if you're like me and not normally great at these games.

That being said, I absolutely love Fighterz. As a huge fan of Dragon Ball for as long as I can remember, this game is a perfect example of the high energy, character and action that is Toriyama's manga. The game is a passion project that has reminded me of how much I enjoy this franchise and the value I hold for each of its characters.

Despite the difficulties I've mentioned as a player, Fighterz offers a great deal in the way of training its players. From its fantastic tutorial and combo challenges to introduce us to each of the 24 characters (the former teaching basic mechanics in an easy to define way, the latter requiring us to perform 10 combos with a character for each of our roster) and learning the basics of the game. I was familiar with L,M,H and their crouching variants but before these tutorials I never experimented with combos, assists and the like and as a result of these, alongside the community's own guides I've been able to at least make a dent in the mountain I've got to climb if I want to be good.

Each of the 24 has an enjoyable playstyle that does well in exemplifying who they were in the series and what they contribute to the franchise. I can say after playing them all that I've liked almost everyone of them and think they all can act as a valuable member of whatever team you decide to build.

The only issue I would say this game suffers from is an awful story mode, full of repeated fights, terrible AI that will just stand still the whole match and a dragged out story. These parts of the game really weaken the overall product by acting as hours of boredom that are only saved by the Fighterz-exclusive character Android 21, a fun and likeable addition to the cast and the DB fandom, and the individual character interactions the game presents based on whatever team you assemble. Gohan asking Vegeta to train after being scolded, Ginyu being too afraid to steal Cell's body because his skin pattern reminds him of a frog, Android 18 making fun of Yamcha's uselessness and more are all some of the great conversations you can unlock that will give the wide cast of characters chances to have conversations about topics the series generally does not let them do.

Overall, Fighterz is a fantastic game full of great characters to learn and combinations to master as you get better with it, offering a great new fighter in the form of Android 21 but unfortunately offers players a storymode that is basically practice mode without auto-recovery health.

For those reasons, I give Fighterz an 8/10",1524355894,1524355894,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,81,3,13202,0,3381,1569797399

it is a pretty easy game to pick up and learn, and definitely isnt on the level of fundamental depth you find in games like guilty gear or tekken, but that doesnt mean the game is weak. its fun and challenging in its own right, as well as being very open to casuals and newcomers, and theres still a lot to learn and get good at in regards to managing your team, team synergy, movement and spacing, proper use of the games mechanics, all that shit

admittedly, this game has a few quirks that have definitely tired me out:

>[i]ridiculously[/i] long combos. the damage is more or less fair, but between all the assist extensions, vanishes, super animations and whatever, youre going to be watching for 10-15+ seconds on a regular basis. im use to combos, ive been playing FGs casually for half of my life, but DBFZs combos overstay their welcome imo and make it difficult to shrug off getting hit. theyre fun to do and all, but in DBFZ moreso than many other fighters, it sucks to be subjected to them

>character imbalance. its nothing too crazy that you cant beat these characters as long as youre decent at the game and know the matchups, but there is a painfully obvious meta. adult gohan and cell are amazing characters that are just generally more capable than any other char in the roster with great pressure and shit, android 16 gets hard knockdowns whenever he wants and is a grappler with every tool he needs as well as amazing movement thanks to DBFZs gameplay, goku black to a lesser extent is an almost perfect character with tools for everything you could want and no real weaknesses, and vegetas assist outshines all other assists by a extravagantly clear margine. its annoying to have a team put together that you really like when you know so many people default to a combination of the above few characters

>lack of developer support beyond quality-of-life changes and season pass content. there have been a variety of welcome tweaks to the menu system and junk since release, and the DLC characters are being churned out slowly but surely. however, there are still glaring issues with the games lobby system and netcode, nothing has been done to attempt to balance the roster, and theres no way to interact with other players ingame on PC, just off the top of my head. since release, while i maintained hope that some things were getting ironed out, nothing has changed with the games obvious problems/shortcomings

thats all i personally have to complain about, though, and it wont really disrupt your enjoyment of the game if you can look past this stuff. ive stopped playing more or less at around 200 hours in favor of tighter and more involved games like tekken and guilty gear, but i can recommend DBFZ

if you involve yourself in a community like the r/dragonballfighterz discord, youre bound to learn and have a good time playing with peeps. the game plays great, and the awesome visuals, sounds (bar a glitchy crackle here and there), and recognizeable characters are really sweet icing on the cake. just remember that fighting games arent for the faint of heart; be okay with getting your shit pushed and be prepared to learn and apply yourself",1524330953,1524330953,TRUE,1,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,142,4,13691,0,13222,1534783167

Combos and how they are excecuted can be done simply, but going further to hit 40-50% in a solid combo requires alot of patience.

41550978,english,"As a fighting game: This game stands king. This is the game SO many people have been looking forward to. A pure fighting game, with proper mechanics and Dragon Ball characters to boot. However, personally, I didn't care for it and here's why:

#001: 3 vs 3. This creates FAST gameplay, devastating combos and flashy attacks. You see characters switching in and out of the screen, practically flawless and fluid. However, I am one of the minority who just can't get into this. It's in my opinion, messy and supports button mashing all too well. If you aren't good at the game, don't even step into mutiplayer. You'll be dead in seconds. Literally. If you're looking for some classic 1v1 fighting, you're better off playing one of the old budokai games on PS2.

#002: Auto combos. This is probably the worst thing about the game. There seems to be no actual timing required to use combos, with some combos even letting you hold your button down. While this is beginner friendly, it's near impossible not to be touched in game by a masher, no matter how well you play.

#003: Transformations: One of the biggest letdowns, for me personally, was the inability to transform at will with a separate energy source. Even the old budokai games had this. The ability to push the battle one step further and transform into a super saiyan at will would have been a great feature. Instead, you have to use ultimates and combos to ""transform"" then ""transform back"". Just like Xenoverse, they'd rather create a separate character for this, instead of implementing a method of transformation.

What I liked:

#001: Graphics: Supporting rather low end processors and graphics cards, this game is absolutely stunning in visuals. Cranking them up to max feels satisfying as you pound your opponent into the dirt using flashy combos and powerful ki blasts with a fluid 60 frames.

#002: Soundtrack: From the moment you turn the game on, you are seduced by an awesome soundtrack that really helps you feel the heat from the battles. 

#003: Roster: With a growing roster and fan favorite characters, you almost forget that you're usually fighting the same person you're using. However, compared to games such as those in the Naruto franchise, and Budokai Tenkaichi 3, the roster is lacking.

Overall: The game delivered what it promised. It's a bit too fast paced for my liking, but it stands as the best fighting game in years.  Personally, I've been missing the ""old"" style of Dragon Ball games, which seems to have died off after Raging Blast 2.  A cool 3D world where your attacks create craters, you're able to freely transform and overpower your opponents, with a roster of 50+ characters. Those are the games I miss.

           Overall, the game is pretty good but highly overpriced for what it is.  The graphics are nice and the gameplay is pretty solid, but it's nothing to get excited about.  The story mode is to simply put it,  terrible, and unlocking the three secret characters is a long and painful process.  One of them you can only unlock by completing the previously mentioned horrible story mode, and for the other two you're probably better off just buying them as DLC.  On the topic of DLC, the devs announced that there will be not one, or two, but eight total DLC characters that were going to be released in the future.  Now I would be okay with this but they made this announcement BEFORE THE GAME'S INITIAL RELEASE!  This makes me feel that the game is being treated more like some sort of cash cow rather than a proper flagship title.  Summing it up, only buy this game if it's on sale. I cannot reccomend buying it for full price as I can't think of a reason to validate the sixty dollar price tag.

UPDATE:  So the first DLC characters came out fairly recently and for what they are, they are extremely overpriced just like the rest of this game.  The hefty price tag on the DLC Characters pretty much confirms my thoughts on this game being nothing more than a money pit  of sorts for the devs, which makes me sad because the game itself isn't bad and has potential to be really good.

one of the best dbz games to come out in a long time, finally abandoning the crappy arena type gameplay we see in xv 1 &2, we get a game that is a fighting game first and a dbz game second.  only problem i originally had is that its roster was a bit too small but now with my 90+ hours of gameplay it doesnt bother me as much seeing how all of the characters have pretty unique playstyles. Story mode was a very nice adddition letting you choose your own teams and the cutscenes between certain characters were great (Gotenks and ginyu pose off was awesome!). splitting the story between 3 arcs was a good call to show us the story from goku, frieza and 18's point of view. 

Arcade mode is really well done in this game changing the course of the tower and the team you fight depending on your score. whilst the first 3 towers are easy DO NOT ATTEMPT THE HARD ONES UNLESS YOU ARE VERY SKILLED OR WANT A CHALLANGE?

41428908,english,"This game is the first fighting game that manages to allow casual players to have a good time without compromising depth. The mechanical depth of the game is about as much as you might find in any other competitive fighting game. The roster might be a bit on the smaller side, but each character has enough unique aspects to how they play that the game's roster feels nicely filled out. The gameplay is sharp, responsive, complex, and most of all fun. Each hit lands with the same kind of power you'd expect from characters hailing from the king of over the top action, Dragon Ball Z, the attacks are fast, flashy, satisfying and gorgeous.
The game's visuals and sound design are killer, especially the former. The deceptively simple looking character models manage to come alive, ending up far more animated and expressive than any other Dragon Ball game to date. The bright colors and simple but dynamic cell shading do a good job not only making the game look gorgeous, but providing visual clarity, as it's always obvious what attack each character is throwing out through easily readable silhouettes and models that never feel to visually busy.
To top it off, there's plenty of fanservice for people picking up the game based on a love of the show rather than the competitive gaming scene. Characters have special voice lines, animations, match finishers, and more that manage to provide fun entertainment for longtime fans (like myself) without affecting gameplay at all. Seeing Krillin replace Android 17 to team up with 18 to deliver a powerful combo or reliving the heart pounding moment when Gohan overpowered Cell has never been more satisfying, as the player is given the power to do it themselves.
The game isn't perfect, however. The online and offline lobby system is clunky and unneccessary, the season pass DLC model adds an extra $35 expense to a game that's already full price, and while the balance is quite impressive, there are a few characters that as of now feel just a bit better than all the others. However, these aren't enough to dissuade me from reccommending this game to fans of the show and FGC lab monsters alike, as it's an absolute blast with a currently thriving community.

Then the first footage for this game dropped. I thought to myself, 'Finally! It's like Budokai 4! I've been waiting so long for this!' Quite honestly, it's a fan's wet dream. The characters are gorgeous, the music gets you pumped up, and a lot of the awesome moves you've seen in the anime show up here recreated very faithfully. My problem is that I get fairly competitive when playing games against other players. In most games, that serves me just fine. In this game though, getting my ass kicked causes next level rage. Make no mistake, you will get your ass kicked. A lot. The better players can actually keep you air juggled for most of the match while you watch helplessly waiting for their combos to end. And that's my biggest problem playing online. There is NO WAY to get out of a combo until it's finished. If your opponent is skilled enough to pull aerial cancels they can keep that combo going for what feels like an age. This has led me to more than one smashed controller and I even had to stop playing for a while because all that anger built up to the point that it was toxic. My advice?

However, as of recent, they added offline lobbies, and thank god for that because now I can finally play local battles without the need for internet connection (thanks ArcSys!). Also they've been patching the servers frequently and although they still aren't top notch, they are tolerable now.

Cons:
-Story Mode feels like something you have to do just to say you completed it rather than something you can really enjoy.  The enemies are extremely easy to defeat, and the story doesn't tie you in like the animes do.

This game is the first fighting game I've played. ""But you've played xenoverse one-"" The FIRST FIGHTING game I have played. And I have to say I'm impressed.

I've gone though the normal noob route. Dashing towards enemies every single time, not using assists, basic combos. Over time I learned some new things, first was the jump cancel, which I just added to the end of combos for extra damage. Now I'm learning more advanced combos, when to use assists, but I'm still strugging with escaping the corners! >:c

While there are some things I'd like to see improved, such as arcade mode rewards, end of match chat, being able to do stuff while waiting for a match, and finally some skins that aren't just colour changes.

I like the dlc so far, the characters are fun and polished like the other characters, the graphics are nice although they are a bit lacking in some places...Such as the planet when there's a destructive view from space, or when the characters fly into a rock and they turn into that bad little black cut-out.

Maybe the game would benefit from a history mode? Such as with the before mentioned Xenoverse, but this should be rather optional, and full of fun cutscenes with their new amazing graphics, such as with the special finishers!

41182269,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is the best Dragon Ball game ever, one of the best 2D fighters in this generation and, above all of that, a love letter to the series who inspired a whole generation.

The graphics, character models and animations, stages, special effects...all of them look absolutely gorgeous and go along perfectly well with the tone of the game.

The music is absolutely gorgeous (trademark and courtesy of Arc System Works), the sound effects are top tier and the voices are great too (I don't know about the english dub, but the original voices in japanese infuse the game with life).

As for the gameplay, DBFZ is an easy to pick-up-and-play, but hard to master game. It's a 3v3 tag team fighter where teammates can be used as assists to escape troublesome situations or apply pressure, but you can also switch between members during the fight looking for more favourable matchups or to recover some life. It has an autocombo feature, overheads, mixups, ki blasts, rushes, double jumps, and of course supers and ultimates. In concluion a good plethora or options when fighting that makes it similar to MvC3.

But above all, it's the different playstyle in each characters that enrichens the game. Each and every character feels and plays different. Compared to the Budokai series, where almost a hundred characters (compared to the tewnty-some in DBFZ) existed, but each of them with the same attack patterns and execution, this is a huge level-up. DBFZ feels and plays like a god-tier fighting game, stepping up to the heights of SFV, KOFXIV, Tekken7 or MvC3.

As for replay value, we may find the biggest flaw of DBFZ in the story mode. While the approach is good (a brand new storyline that lets you acquire and develop characters, going from stage to stage) the execution is poor: I don't think I lost one single character, let alone a match, in this mode, as it is insultingly easy. More challenge can be found in the arcade mode and, obviously, going online, but the story mode that could have been brilliant is just a waste due to the (non-existing) difficulty spike. That doesn't make the game less desirable, it just lets a good opportunity slide.

The other negative aspect of DBFZ is the DLC policy: the game came out with twenty-some characters at full rpice, but you can pay 35 extra bucks for 8 extra characters and 15 more for extra tracks. While this has become a trend in fighting games, I can only feel sorry for such a money-hungry approach.

All in all, DBFZ is an amazing fighting game, a must-purchase for Dragon Ball Fans and a fighter that can be picked up for new gamers wanting to give this genre a try and consumed fighting game players looking up for a challenge. I give it a 9/10 and with a couple of stitches here and there, it coul have raised even higher.

It's absolutely capable of entertaining casual audiences, thanks to it's simple controls, almost as good as Smash Bros. and can be taken to a very hardcore level, just like Marvel vs Capcom 3. The game doesn't have easy touches of death like Marvel 3 had, but it is very snowbally, expect to block for a while if your opponent knows what he's doing and don't be surprised if you get opened up 3 times in a row in the corner.

Every character is suitable for competitive play, even though some are better than others (you WILL see Goku Black, Cell, Hit, Android 16, Adult Gohan and SS Vegeta A LOT), there's nothing stopping you from playing lower tier characters such as Captain Ginyu, Krillin, Yamcha and Beerus with great success! I'm playing Trunks, Yamcha and Beerus and I'm quite high ranked (560k BP, around the top 2000 players on PC).

The netcode is pretty good, can't complain. The servers were buggy on launch but I haven't had a connection problem in a while.

The soundtrack is VERY nice, but the devs are unfortunately trying to sell an anime music pack for quite a high price, eh, don't buy that.

The single player is better than most fighting games around, actually. The story is nice if you're a fan of Dragon Ball I guess, but the gameplay itself is too easy, most bots don't even react until near the end of the first arc (which is actually a good thing if you just want to unlock Android 21, but I guess more casual players won't enjoy that too much).

41166718,english,"If you are a fan of fighting games, chances are you have played or bought this title already and have formed your own opinions on it. Instead, I'll cater this review to those who may not be the kind to play in competition or those who are new to the genre entirely.

Dragon Ball FighterZ is extremely accessible. Special move motions are no more complex than quarter-circles (and half-circles if you wish to activate the super combo of a teammate mid-combo), the utility of normal attacks is somewhat universal: every forward + medium is an overhead, every down + heavy is invincible to airborne attacks, every down + medium is a low. Auto combos are very well designed. They are by no means optimal, but once starting an autocombo, you are not comitted to only completing that specific sequences of attacks, allowing new players to start using the standard auto combos, and eventually expanding on their use by cancelling the auto combos into other normals, specials, or supers.

Despite being accessible, I have to admit the tutorials are absolute trash, especially when compared to other titles by Arc System Works. The tutorials explain most mechanics on the most basic level and require very little actual understanding on the part of the player to complete the challenges (if they require completion at all), and the combo trials are largely wasted on auto-combos that are identical in execution between characters, and those which aren't auto combos are useless, unoptimal, and do a terrible job of demonstrating the characters unusual combo routes. If you want to learn this game, you are on your own. Fortunately, there is a wealth of information for both new and experienced players to hit the ground running with the game, but this absolutely has to be mentioned.

If you have dabbled in a fighting game or two and wish to ""git gud,"" the skill ceiling of this game is enormously high. Anyone who had worries the game would be too simplistic is simply wrong. Applying pressure requires careful consideration of your opponent's tendencies [insert Adult Gohan joke here], defense requires a strong knowledge of the offender's capabilities, and you will get destroyed in neutral if you committ too hard to one thing.

Speaking of committing, this is where assists come in. Assists are more essential to this game than probably any Marvel vs. Capcom-style game in recent memory. In most ""versus"" titles, characters are a complete toolset, able to apply pressure, mixup, and complete devastating combos by themselves. By default, DBFZ characters aren't able to sustain pressure for very long, and it it can be extremely difficult to impossible to combo out of overhead attacks without leaving yourself open. Pressing buttons in neutral can be highly committal, and once a combo goes on for a long time, combo options become limited. Assists nullify all of these problem, making managing them absolutely paramount to success. You could argue assists feel more ""important"" in DBFZ than in other tag-team games, but that's my opinion.

As far as single player content goes? Honestly, I'm the wrong person to ask. I personally believe that playing fighting games against AI is to completely defeat the purpose of playing fighting games in the first place. After all, you're playing in a way which the mechanics were not designed around, the interaction between two players who do not know the other's next move with certainty. Story mode is pretty entertaining for the first third, but then gets extremely tedious.

40404827,english,"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I used to love this game. I thought it was absolutely great and the best fighting game to come out in a very long time.

That being said, after playing this game along side Guilty Gear, UNIST and Blazblue, I just don't think it's for me. 

I won't talk about the terrible online and lobby system because many reviews have spoken about this already. 

But i've been in denial about it's gameplay for a while. The more I kept playing and kept playing, the more samey things started to become. All the combos I would do would all be the same. All the combos my opponent would do would be the same no matter what character they'd use. (granted some are a bit different, over all it all still plays the same) Apart from your netural, it just doesn't feel very rewarding. 

Some of the balance on characters are just jacked up. It's become a meme that Vegeta is in damn near everyone's team as support. Some characters are ridiclous like SSGSS' auto combo being a low which goes into a mid. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if the online wasn't behaving poorly and causing lag. So I would end up getting hit by it nearly every single time. 

Another issue is the auto combos. Not that I have a problen with autocombos in general, but the autocombo getting completed before connecting I still don't understand. Nearly every anime fighter i've played have the combo start only when the first one hit, And that's fine. But in this game, you can literally just mash it and it will complete.

Overall, it was a game I had fun with...But only with friends and offline. It became a very sour and bitter experience once I played online. Not much of any enjoyment. Not much of any reward. Just battling with the terrible netcode, struggling to find a match for literally 3-5 minutes and all the other reasons listed above. It's sad because I was really looking forward to it but the more I played it, the worse my opinion got with this game. It could be that it's just the online that soured me overall or maybe it helped me realised my other issues with the game.

UPDATE:

Since the update to the game, some of the previously stated problems with the network have been addressed and fixed. So far, these are what i've noticed:

- Netcode doesn't lag as nearly as bad as it did before
- Giving me the option to pick offline and online from the start
- Best 5 out of 3 instead of best 2 out of 3
- Reduced wait time for the opponent to accept the match
- Able to find matches MUCH quicker than before.


Final Update:

So I've given the gameplay a chance again and while it succeeded in every other area, the linear, boring gameplay let it down once again.

The balance problems still remain. Nearly team consists of Vegeta (for assists), SSGSS Goku, Goku Black and Gohan. If you're lucky you'll get all of them in the same team quite often. 

I still feel the general chaotic neutral and the combos still barely feel very different at all minus the inclusion of assists to continue the combos. 

Sadly it's still simply just not for me and I still have very little enjoyment even after the patch. I'm aware that the rather toxic majority of the community doesn't like that and that's fine but i'm just being honest.",1519611209,1522427180,FALSE,66,11,0.527516842,12,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,129,30,3125,0,2799,1582982900

There are better 2D fighters out there, but I know, I know, you want a Dragonball Fighting game. It's funny how it delivers on that front and still fails in every way to promote shelf longevity out the gate. The story is trash and filled with clone fights, a glorified survival mode. The roster is the same cats we've been seeing for years with the promise of additional characters (because we've fallen so far in standards that games merits are solely about what they promise us after we waste sixty bucks) and the netplay is ass.

The mechanics and presentation are great. I can enjoy the gameplay greatly but the surrounding failures drag it down into the mud. If this is what Ak-Sys has in mind now, I dread the next wallet-stillbirth I have when I buy into BlazBlue Cross Tag.

41086875,english,"For many years, Dragon Ball Fans have consistently requested for a true actual Dragon Ball fighting game. Finally after the struggle we have one. Is it worth your time and money? We'll see.

[b] Story [/b]
With the new addition of Andriod 21 designed by Akira Toriyama, of course we are also introduced to a new story to accompany her. The story is divided up into 3 parts. Super Warrior Arc, Enemy Warrior Arc, and finally the Andriod 21 arc.
Each of the arcs sort of has it's own ""perspective"" What I mean by that is, in the Super Warrior Arc we can see Frieza and Cell get eaten and absorbed by Andriod 21 for her to grow stronger to fight her off in the final battle. However, in the Enemy Warrior Arc, Frieza and Cell are actually not eaten but rather help Goku in the final battle against Andriod 21. The actual ""canon"" story relating to Andriod 21, would have to be her own arc. If I'm to be completely honest with you. I didn't give two shits about the story. While I find it great with the cutscenes and voice acting which is absolutely amazing. The actual story... is actually pretty forgettable. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]
I will say this now. I believe Dragon Ball FighterZ to be THE BEST fighting game on the market currently. Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't a 1 on 1 fighting game. Rather, it's a 3 on 3 fighting game. The mechanics in Dragon Ball FighterZ are just amazing. This game just screams creativity. You can create some awesome, over the top creative flashy stuff, or some evil cheap crap to throw your opponents off. I love that! It allows the player to further dive into practice mode alot more often. Whenever I hop into practice mode, I always find out something new. I know of those who don't like the 3 on 3 combat style. However, believe me that it is absolutely amazing in this game. Now will all that's good comes with bad. The thing that sets the fire on the community and game are ""auto combos"" and it's understandable too. Essentially, auto combos are literally... AUTO COMBOS. You sit there, hit a button mutliple times until the combo ends. This promotes SPAMMING, this is in no way a good thing for players. Especially ones that are new and learning to play. Since the most common thing with newcomers to fighting games is spamming, here spamming actually looks like they are doing something. The auto combos have tracking, no matter how fluid your movement and cross up game is you will eventually get hit. This is absolutely disgusting. The thing with auto combos, they give you sort of ""unique"" types of strings or animations. For example, Trunks. Trunks has an auto combo string that leads into a crossup followup. It's really good but it's locked behind an auto combo. Therefore even influencing button mashing and spamming in the game. I believe this to be the absolute worse thing in this game.

[b] Graphics [/b]
The graphics in this game are absolutely amazing. After hearing that Arc Systems were making this I expected amazing visuals, and that is exactly what we got. You can increase resolution scaling to make the game look absolutely cripsy clear and clean. Arc Systems has probably the best looking anime games out there.

[b] Soundtrack [/b]
The soundtrack is this game is absolutely amazing. It captures that fighting spirit and motivation to improve your game. Every single track in this game is easy to remember and sounds great.

[b] Difficulty [/b]
Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't a hard game to pick up. It's really beginner friendly and encourages those who aren't exactly interested in fighting games to get into them. The tutorial is simple and clean, showing off tips and tricks you can do in this game. Arc Systems usually have great tutorials in their fighting games. My problem with this however, there are MULTIPLE things the game doesn't teach you, nor let you know of these. For example, did you know you can tag into another partner in your team without using your special and then switching to them? Did you know that if you dragon rush and hold a button down instead of 21 hits you get 31 for more damage? Did you know that if you press up, hold foward and press the right trigger you can do an easy Instant Air Dash compared to the manual way with the dpad or stick? The game doesn't tell you any of this. Now, this could be to encourage players to discover more in practice mode, but I personally believe that these are core mechanics of the game that should be shown to the player to make them aware.

[b] DLC Handling [/b]
I can't go exactly too much into detail since we don't the full roster of DLC characters, but I will try my best. I'm not going to refer to datamines or leaks, because I don't want to give false information. So far we know that there will be 8 new characters. So far we know 2 out of the 8. Bardock and Broly. the actual pricing of them is not confirmed yet however. I'll update this section of my review upon new information.

[b] Pricing [/b]
To be completely honest, I don't think Dragon Ball FighterZ is asking for TOO much... but the price could be reduced. 
The game's roster looks acceptable in my standards. But somtimes it just looks really damn small due to the 3 on 3 gameplay style. The roster includes fan favorite characters, I'm pretty sure everyone is completly fine with this base roster. 

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Dragon Ball FighterZ is an excellent game for newcomers and pros. As I said before, I believe this to be the best fighting game on the market currently. If you are looking for a fighting game, or you just like Dragon Ball, or you want to get into a fighting game that is easy on controls and mechanics then this is the game for you.

Lets talk pros:
- Gameplay: It's easy to learn, and a bit hard to master. Giving characters auto-combos and simplified inputs allow for anyone (with a small amount of knowledge on fighting games) to pick up and play, while leaving enough room to find hidden mechanics and optimal combos.
-Graphics: It looks great......That is all.
-Music: The themes sound amazing and they represent their according character and place perfectly.
-Ranked: This is my first time playing a ranked mode in a fighting game, and I gotta say, it's great. Even with only to bars the matches flow smoothly, and every fight has pushed me to become better at the game, even a loss feels alright as long as I can stop and rethink what I did wrong and learn form my mistakes.
Now, for the few cons:
-Story: The first arc was alright, the second arc was great, the third arc......eeeeeehhhhh...... It padded a lot in the begining, and by the time I could start having pre-battle interactions (the best part of the story mode) it arrived too late and I just wanted to get to the ending. I'm glad I played the story mode, but I wont ever touch it again, not even to farm zenis in hard mode.
-Uuuuhhhh: .....I think that's the only complain I have....... The rest is just nitpicks..... So, uh, yeah.
TL;DR: Game is great, story fizzles out by the end.

(i.e. Vegeta can ki blast damn near rapid fire and the like while Gohan's ki blasts are not so. One shot typically.) These minor tweeks between characters give a variety and those who dig deeper can find combinations that just mop the floor with folks.

The Bad:
If you are not looking to dig deeper, it'll just seem to be 'spam light attack, big move just as they hit the ground or whatever... 
It'll seem repetitive in that light and the slight differences won't be capitalized on.

The Other:
The story is a bit unique and is amusing to go through as well as some scenes where, if you have certain characters, they'll banter before the fight. (Still amused about Gotenks trying to figure out what to call Goku and Vegeta because 'dad' didn't seem right.)

It's mechanics are simple enough (Evil Zone is exceedingly simple but the same general mentality works here) and the more time you put into learning combinations and team super linking, the more fun you'll have with it.",1520907345,1522011022,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,36,3,394,0,393,1521865313

This game is only as popular as it is, because it's attached to the Dragon Ball franchise. If any other game released had as many problems as this one does, it would be raked over the coals for it.

The long review:

First off this game is gorgeous, and an excellent attempt at bringing the Dragon Ball universe into a 2D fighter in terms of style and visual fidelity. That's clearly where most of the effort and money was spent however, because the rest of the game flops pretty hard. 

Story mode is sort of what you'd expect for a fighter. It's dumb, and the plot is shoehorned into to what is essentially a long practice mode. That's what it does well however. It offers you a variety of players to choose from, and does an ok job of slowly introducing you to the game mechanics. But lets be honest here. You didn't think about buying this game for a story mode. 

The online multiplayer is without question, the worst experience I've had in any major release, for any genre of game. As other reviews have stated, the lobby system is a joke and full of problems. It takes a long time to even navigate to the lobby (load game, choose online or offline mode, choose region, skip opening cinematic, choose lobby number, load lobby, warp to world match, wait), and even longer to get into a match. You'll be siitting for at least a couple of minutes before you find a match. Once you find the match however, there's no guarantee it's going to keep you connected, as dropped matches are very common. WHEN that happens, until recently, the game booted you back to region select instead of the main lobby and you have to repeat this process over again. It's a complete joke. 

It wouldn't be so bad if matchmaking wasn't paused for every other actioin you take, while waiting for a match. Want to look through your lobby characters? Matchmaking pauses. Change your emblem or logo, or buy capsules, edit team, or BG music etc.? Matchmaking pauses.

Which also brings me to the next point of premade teams. You CANNOT change your team once a match has been found. You MUST select your team before matchmaking. Whoever thought this was a good idea, needs to be fired.

Onto balance. There is none. There's only been a few tournaments thus far, but the amount of tier whoring in this game is insane. You are going to run into a Goku Black every game. Followed by either Cell, Adult Gohan, Android 16, and Vegeta. There is no semblence of balance right now, which is a shame because your nostalgia buttons are definitely going to be pushed.

So overall I can't recommend this game. If it didn't have dragon ball on it, I wouldn't have bought it. It's still a good year away from actually being a polished game, so save your money, and your time.",1521953098,1521953098,FALSE,4,0,0.435849935,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,50,4,7783,0,5961,1528500173

It's what I have been waiting for very long! 
Affter playing Xenoverse 1 and 2 on my consol (wich I really loved) I can only say that FighterZ is so so much better and gives that real DragonBall feeling to the player!
Only 13hours in the game but its gonna go up to 100+  if not even 1000+ because its simply amazing!

Pros:
- Amazing animation that makes you fell as if you watch a Dragon Ball Z Movie 
- Every character has his own unique skill set and moves 
- short stories happen sometimes before and after the battles witch makes the game just so much more fun
- lobby is funn and the avatars are really cute
- there are plenty of diffrent game options from story to ranking matches and all the other ones
- the game is prety simple to learn but yet very hard to master

Cons:
- At some parts the game is maybe too hard (or its just me being a noob and I dont mean ""online matches against acctualy people with this"")
- I think the trick of ""buy SSGSS Vegeta and Goku"" is simply mean since you can unlock them in the game and there is no need to spend money or them or trick you audience to buy them

To be honest if you ask me there are no real cons when it comes to this game that made me rage quit! I am just to bad at the game so the difficult is too hard for me and thats about it haha

well the price is maybe 60€ wich is a lot of money and the DLC is another 30€ but to be honest its not too expensive for a game like this.
I did not buy the 30€ dlc yet but will in a few weeks.

Dragon Ball FighterZ has an easy to learn combat system, but deep enough for enthusiasts to spend hours mastering. (Pro Gaming potential for sure) Anyone familiar with Capcom fighters will feel right at home with this game. 

Despite its derivative nature, Dragon Ball FighterZ excels in the style department capturing the feel of the anime. I grew up watching Dragonball Z. It was sort of an entry point into anime, along with Macross and Gundam. It was a delight to play as Teen Gohan, taking on Cell. Kudos to the game designers!

Problems existed primarily in the UI. The main game HUB features chibi characters and a convuluted menu. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my straight forward design. 

Overall, good time to be had in Dragon Ball FighterZ. I recommend playing online with friends. The singleplayer Story Mode will only get you so far.

10/10
Highly Recommended!

The combat flows well, the speed of the game is dependant on the player's skill level, and the game has incredible depth and room for you to grow once the basics are understood.

Easily accessible to fighting-game newcomers, due to auto-combos, but still, both the game mechanics and the combos you can actually pull off go a lot deeper and are a lot more complicated than first meets the eye, enough so to keep even professional fighting-game veterans occupied and practicing in training mode for months!

The visuals are absolutely perfect, the characters really look and feel like the original characters with their original designs from the anime, and there are so many little references and call-backs to things in the anime that it's just a treat to play. Even the way each character fights makes you feel like it makes sense, and a big part of that being that almost every move a character will use in their fighting style has been taken from the anime or manga itself, and really makes that character (any character) feel like a unique fighter!

The audio, until very recently, was a little buggy (some characters would call out the wrong names when calling assisst characters), but that was adressed and fixed, otherwise everything else is great. You have a wide-range of classic and new and original songs to listen to while playing, so whether you're looking for the good old songs from the anime or just want some heavy metal/electronic music to listen to, you can do both, and both sound great!

The only problem with this game is some lag while playing online, but to me it's not really a problem with the game itself, seeing as how I can still find many people with good/decent connections to play with, so it's really just a bad internet issue and about finding the right people to play with.

40924371,english,"This is probably the best team fighter that's come out in years. I actually adore this game. It fills with me pure enjoyment that I haven't felt in a fighter since Marvel VS Capcom 3's original launch. 3v3 is such a perfect format for an anime fighter like this and after having experienced it I definitely think it was the only way for it to be as good as it is. Matches are fast and flashy, and even if you're getting fucking destroyed all the animations are clear enough to understand HOW you're getting destroyed. Despite this game being a Dragon Ball fighter, it has enough depth in the gameplay to really hook anyone who's been a fan of 3v3 fighters of recent years.

There's a good selection of characters, if you're a Dragon Ball fan you'll find a pretty balanced selection of fighters both from the original arcs all the way up to Super. One of your favorite characters is bound to be in this lineup. Things can sometimes feel too universal between all of them but overall there's enough distinction between the way most characters control that it doesn't bother me. If you aren't a Dragon Ball fan or have never gotten into the series things will be pretty alright too, every character has enough of their personality to make them interesting even without the context behind them.

Though, if I had to change one thing, I'd make defensive play more of a viable option. Matches in FighterZ can oftentimes feel like blockstring after blockstring and there's not really any good way to get out of pressure once you're in it. If you're an aggressive player who's used to rushdowns and mixups this is your game, but you'll have a much harder time taking it slow and forcing patterns into your opponents.

Balance is really good in my opinion. Every character as of 3/19/18 feels really viable and you can really pull some cool stuff off if your team has good synergy. Some are clearly better than others (Sometimes I feel like a good 16 genuinely has no weakness when paired with certain assists) but in general every character can work and work WELL. I can only hope the DLC releases will be as balanced as this main cast.

Then there's the STYLE. This game bleeds Dragon Ball. Is IS Dragon Ball. ArcSys really should be applauded at just how well the environments, characters, and attacks look. They've used their signature style of making 3D models that look like 2D animation the Guilty Gear series usually uses to its fullest here, as every single screenshot of the game genuinely looks like a frame from the show. I really cannot describe how god damn good this game looks in motion through text, my best advice here would be to look up some footage of matches in action, since they're a real marvel to behold.

Finally, the online. The online is fine. It's frame delay based and not fucking rollback based so it already gets a point from me (What the FUCK Street Fighter V) and most of the time matches don't dip beyond 3 - 4 frames of delay even with a pretty run of the mill connection. You also get matches pretty consistently now, as even during hours that aren't peak hours you'll get 2 - 3 bar connection matches at least every 1 - 3 minutes. The matchmaking used to be really fucked but they've fixed it in a recent patch, and in my experience it's pretty consistent now.

Overall, this game is an amazing fighter. I'm a bit biased due to preferring games like Marvel and Skullgirls over Tekken and Street Fighter but I genuinely believe this is the best fighter that's come out in recent years. At the very least, it's the game that's had the most love poured into it, and I hope I'll be playing this one as long as I did Marvel 3.",1521482969,1521482969,TRUE,1,0,0.518072307,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,456,19,15240,0,3204,1600379099

40885755,english,"STORY:
in terms of the story alone, it tells the story it needs to tell. whether or not the story is good is up to you. i personally found the story itself lacking, and having some holes and unexplained scenarios here and there. for the gameplay, it's nice, especially for a newer player of fighting games such as myself. it brings you into the basics and allows you to grasp a natural reaction to playing. this helped out since i knew the 3d aspect of dragonball games far better than i do traditional fighters. the tutorials in the first arc start getting annoying, when you're being told to complete tasks you've already completed before, but it leaves by the 2nd arc and the hard mode doesn't have them either. however, especially coming into the 3rd arc, the gameplay becomes awfully samey. the difficulty doesn't necessarily change, which is fine for the first arc where you're getting into the swing of things, but once you have a grasp on it, you're very rearely losing more than a character, if at all. it's worse since the 3rd arc is a lot of fighting the same bots, having 21 scream a little, and then doing it again. 

ARCADE MODE: 
it's okay. it has the aspect that it's still part of the gameplay, which is great regardless of where it's put, but Arcade actually adds difficulty to the matter. especially in the later ""hard mode"" stages, where you can be absolutely smashed for minor mistakes that the AI has already read and assessed. the problem arises that it doesn't have replay value. at most you're doing it by the end for the achievment, and nothing more. because there's no way you're going back into arcade mode over and over just to get destroyed by AI that read your movements, have higher health, damage, and Ki recovery than you. 

ONLINE:
online is, whithout a shadow of a doubt, the best aspect of this game, the combination of new players to the fighting scene, already comfortable players to the fighting scene, the heat of playing against similar skilled players, the thrill of the upperhand against more skilled opponents. it the sole reason why most fighting games get the players they get is because of this. and FighterZ does not disappoint. the graphics, the super attacks, the dramatic finishers, the disrespect of some of the level 3's (looking at you Beerus). the ONLY problems are that A. there is no punishment at the moment for people who cant muster the decency to take a loss, and rage quit, and B. lobby and room connections are (or after this patch were) complete trash. it was a struggle to stay within lobbies while waiting for a match. however, after a couple of patches, they were drastically fixed, and as of making this review, i haven't discoennected since the update. this doesn't stop me from running into people who do, and are the same people giving me 8 - 15 frame delays, but thats not the game's fault, that's the player's with bad internet. 

OVERALL:

- amazing animation heavily influenced by the latest Guilty Gear Xrd
- Fast paced over-the-top action
-Flashy moves and combos that would actually fill you with a ""sense of pride and accomplishment"" *stares at a certain space shooter game*
- No microtransactions other than DLC pass and characters (you use in-game currency to buy colors, lobby characters, titles etc.)
-A fun Ring Party Mode (tag team battle) that has to be tried at least once with a group of 6.
Cons:
-Story Mode seems to be underwhelming, and the only reason to actually do it is to see the characters interact with one another and to unlock a certain Android
- Lag, get ready to experience high FPS delays and connection errors no matter the distance.

39938512,english,"Okay, so this is an excellent fighting game. The fighting is pretty intense and it's very fun. Graphics bring back the old anime feel. However, there are a couple of reasons why this game deserves a bad review. First the lobby system is one of the worst designs I have ever seen. You cannot invite friends to a current game. 

Instead they are forced to manually find the same lobby as you. Not to mention there is no voice chat. This limits the knowledge of even knowing where someone is when you start the game up. There is a follow list. But its pointless because all it does is let you see the players stats. It doesn't tell you if they are even online.

Unless you plan to play this game by yourself then this game falls very short of game with friends. I played against some amazing people in this game and wanted to get some tips from them. But of course you CAN NOT message them in any way. You also cant add them on steam as there is no option for it. 

So this makes training someone or trying to rematch them later nearly impossible. Only preset messages are in the game. This game might as well not even have a lobby feature because its very annoying. Hopefully all this is fixed in the future.

If you want to enjoy this game. Don't play online. That simple, online is a complete waste of time. Also this game is WAY over priced for what it has. For sure not a $60 game. But it's lots of fun if you play offline.

Gameplay is really good, even if you're a beginner, I believe this is one the most accessible fighting games, but like any other, it requires practice in order to get good (you won't be good by just mashing X and do auto-combos all the time), the special moves motions are simple (qcf and qcf), there are some motions that the game doesn't teach you but you can look for them outside the game and what to apply them on (e.g: hcf or hcb to end a combo with an assist dhc without the current character having to super and tk to jump cancel some moves). The 2nd motions mentioned might seem hard but you can play with only a gamepad for sure and the tk (tiger knee) isn't that useful.

Dragon ball fighterz is an amazing fighting game especially with friends. plug your controller or joystick in and play although i wish the final bunch of characters would be a LOT bigger (more than 8) would be amazing and if they could get all the good and strong characters not only from super but the kai and even the gt series would make the game that much better, i would recommend this game because not only is the gameplay extremely smooth the graphics and animations look so good,

one issue i have had with the game was when trying to go into fullscreen windowed the game would crash on the next launch. the only way to fix this (i found) was to delete a file in the game files which reset all story progress which sucks. just go fullscreen instead of fullscreen windowed. it looks the same (although it is annoying) this does not cause the crashing so....",1521100321,1521100321,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,137,26,540,27,431,1600937095

Matches can be long and entertaining and the graphics are taken directly from the anime and manga. And there is nothing more beautiful than a destructive finish where the entire place is erased off the face of the planet.

To add something for the Dragonball fans outhere, this is more of a fighting game than a Dragonball game. If you are new to those and buy this game, you'll face massive amounts of frustration if you don't know what you are paying for.

The gameplay is fast paced and the game is very well balanced. They also added dramatic scenes from the anime with special triggers. This game is a work of Dragonball art first and a game second. The amount of attention they paid to the lore of DBZ is mind blowing.

While it would be easy to compare it to other anime-fighters or 3v3 tag fighters, it finds a comfortable ground somewhere outside of these stereotypes. It is easily said a game that's ""easy enough to play, but hard to master"". The amount of universal moves and the childhood-tickling range of cast members gives you a lot of versatility and variety in both playstyle and options in a match. No fight feels lost till you hit that post-game screen.

My only 2 serious problems with this game:
1.) Netcoding is a bit rough, but they have improved it vastly compared to a few weeks prior. 
2.) They named the rank system ""Battle Points"" instead of Power Level.

40698571,english,"Dragon Ball Fighter Z is a bag of mixed emotions for me tbh. There's a lot that I love about the game, but it has its problems. To begin with, the game has beautiful visuals and holds extremely true to the Dragonball series. the game is loaded with tons of references and a surprisingly interesting and engaging storyline. The game also features a lot of mechanics that add a new level of depth to the anime fighter/ team fighter genre. With moves like dragon rush, banish, and z deflect, they create new methods to approach and turn the tide of battle. 

Unfortunately, the game isn’t perfect. It’s 1 major flaw… The auto combos. The auto combos in this game are extremely annoying and I feel that they take away from combo freedom. I wish they just made the auto combos something you could toggle on/ off or make it a mode you can switch between like stylish mode for GG / BB. In all honestly, it wouldn't be that big of a complaint if they didn’t put an auto combo for damn near every button! (I blame you Bandai). 

The final thing I have to say and yes, you've probably already heard about it, is the servers during the first few months of release were god awful. The lobby system completely ruined the online experience. Only now is this any better. My guess is the only reason the online play is doing better is probably because they lost 80% of their player base. Currently online play feels amazing as I'm getting much lower and more consistent frames when playing against opponents. Just like mama Arc used to make. Other than that, its basically UMVC3 mixed with GG but watered down a bit for newer players to get into. In the end the auto combos are easy to overlook and at the end of the day it’s a really fun and casual team fighter. If you’re a Dragonball fan or someone who just wants to enjoy a good new team fighter then this is the game for you.",1520648976,1520648976,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,865,200,2033,0,1356,1585359083

40227855,english,"FighterZ is one of the best Dragon Ball fighting games you'll find. Arc system works have really proven themselves to be a league above the rest when it comes to the genre. If you love the series or want a new competitive game then this is something for you. 
 
It goes without saying that the animation in this game is stunning. Much like Bandai Namco's Ninja storm series, FighterZ looks just as good as its TV counterpart. There are numerous nods to the series and Easter eggs to find within that will leave any fan very pleased. 
 
But the largest plus are the mechanics: DBFZ has many hidden techniques and ways of chaining combos together that are still being found today. Unlike many other fighters that involve several directional inputs and combo sequences; Anyone can pull off the special moves in this game. The biggest skill difference comes from how well players understand the system, each characters limits, how far a character will bounce, and if you can rush them to keep a combo going. These are a few examples of the depth to combat.

 
So, why have so many players quit this game? Gameplay is fun, Animations are incredible, and an easy entry competitive fighter for new players.  
 
But this can't excuse a blatant lack of content. 
 
Besides a barebones, tedious story mode, and an arcade mode with less depth than the oldest Mortal Kombat games in the 90s. There's not much to do in the game besides Casual and Ranked matches. For the hardcore audience it means little, but casual players have incentive to return. 
 
Including the very slow and restrictive lobby system; FighterZ becomes restrained. While practice is something that all fighting games rely on, without any fun modes to return to can be a drag. This is what created a large drop in the active player base. 
 
Disappointingly, Dragon Ball FighterZ is magnificent; As well as held back by how shallow this excellent gameplay has been implemented.

40660158,english,"I haven't enjoyed a game like this in a long time. It's one of my favourites and I'd recommend it for any player level. The visually stunning graphics and art style combined with the fast paced combat go great together to really highlight their idea of a game that's both welcoming to new players and also rewarding to expert players. I've spent most of my time playing this game on my own as my close friends do not own the game. However, I can only imagine how great it would be for any friends buying this game to play together and I have no doubt about the hours of fun you could have just going all out in constant battles.

The game isn't completely rich in single player content, but the story and arcade modes are certainly enjoyable and can offer a challenge. There are three story arcs with character levelling that make sure you can get a lot out of the story. There aren't individual story lines for each character in the game, but it really goes into detail by offering a variety of dialogues/cut scenes when matching up certain characters for a fight. That little extra touch of content makes it really enjoyable to fans of the series and also helps to offer some light humour throughout the game. Both the story and the arcade mode feature hard mode versions to make sure you get that extra challenge. This will often up the difficulty through giving the CPU unfair gameplay mechanics and making them more aggressive - as you would expect from most fighting games. To add to this, there are plenty of combo challenges to complete with each character to learn how different mechanics work.

The main focus, as with any modern fighting game, is playing online. The online community can be difficult to go up against, but playing ranked offers the higher level of gameplay where timing, combos, health management and fast thinking come together to highlight the depth of the game. Depending on your familiarity with the fighting genre, you might need to spend a lot of time in training where you can practise mechanics that the game doesn't explain to you in the basic tutorials. Personally, I'm not a fan of training, learning combos or researching gameplay online. It comes at a disadvantage, but for me it was the direct action of playing ranked games that helped me to learn more about the game. I've really enjoyed playing online as someone who, I would say, is an intermediate level player. At the time of this review I've reached 530,000 BP, which gives you a Steam achievement. You are rewarded monthly for participating in ranked games and considering the current player base, I expect the game will be surviving for a while now, particularly when the DLC characters are released (which I'm looking forward to already).

There are some updates that the game really needs, but the future does look promising with a recent update from the developers. Currently, there isn't any reliable punishment for rage quitting in ranked mode and there are some lobby-based and match finding issues that exist. However, I can't say these are overwhelming problems and they can be overlooked. There is some content you'd find in other fighting games outside of the actual gameplay that doesn't exist here, such as character skins (there are only colour schemes), a progressive unlock system (all cosmetics are purchased through zeni and randomly given) and lobby activities (even the communication is limited). Fortunately, these aren't relevant to the actual fighting and are more like a bit of candy on the side, rather than the main course.

If you're wondering about this game in comparison to other fighters, I can't give you a great deal of insight as I haven't played enough. This is my first time really enjoying a 3v3 based fighting game and I personally feel this is my favourite. For a PC game, Dragon Ball FighterZ does appear to be holding a large player base with around 2,300 players over a month after release. It really makes me want to start playing other titles from Arc System Works. I've previously played BlazBlue, but I've not really explored the game fully and my hours were fairly minimal.

To conclude, I really do love this game and I've enjoyed it so much. At the time of this review, I have 134.1 hours on record. If the price is a bit of a pain, understandably, wait for a sale. For me, I haven't paid full price for a game in a couple of years as I rarely take an interest in new releases. So, the price of the game wasn't really important.

40641296,english,"The story this game has is pretty interesting and Android 21 is a nicely developed character, however the way single player is executed is just a massive bore. You have three arcs and when you beat the first one you'll unlock the second one and so forth, however it's incredibly linear. You'll be fighting the same enemies (clones) over and over doing the same thing over and over with next to no variation. Then when you unlock the next arc you get to do the exact same thing over and over again, it'll get to the point where you skip nearly all the clones just so you can fight the stage's boss to progress.
A level system with traits that grant effects like increased exp gained or health regen is pretty nice, but the problem is you'll find a particular combination which just invalidates all the others. E.g I had health regen coupled with health being gained from every hit, all you need is those two (unless you want to trigger the character's phase event which is just a grind).
The gameplay itself is visually appealing, and landing your supers/ultimates is very satisfying but that's as far as it goes. The auto-combo system just ruins the gameplay and it's not because it's ""cheap"" or anything like that, it just limits you to what you can actually do. I find that I can't mix and match the way I want because the input are too close to the auto-combo inputs so a level 1 super just gets triggered randomly, in the end I managed to come up with my own combos by avoiding certain inputs which in a fighting game shouldn't even be a thing.
Then there's arcade mode which is just a missed opportunity, I would've loved to have seen character specific endings or post completion scenes, pretty much like how Ultimate Marvel v Capcom did it. Except you'll find yourself just grinding to unlock Super Saiyan Blue Goku and Vegeta, if you pre-ordered the game and got the two from the get go then there really isn't much point in playing it. Hardmode in arcade is just incredibly unbalanced, as you progress through the mode the AI will have increased damage, ki gain and reacts to pretty much anything and everything you do, if there's a single frame for them they'll do it. I did a basic 25 hit combo to the AI and it did just under 40% damage, then the AI hit me twice which dealt 30% damage. 6 hits and I was left with half my health left, so if you can't unlock them via the score you're just going to be grinding for the zene.
Online is just broken either that or Hit just keeps freezing time, if you're not getting disconnected then you're pretty much finding laggy games. And when you do find a game it's just some prick jumping up and down spamming the same move (but then that's not Arc's fault).

39669668,english,"So in usual fashion, as I did with Xenoverse 2, I purchased the game, played it briefly and wrote a scathing review. In Xenoverse 2's case, I was mostly miffed about the reused assets, and how the game didn't feel much different at all apart from 60fps. In FighterZ's case (or ""FZ""), my gripes were heavy but came with the caveat that it isn't necessarily a bad game. The price tag is painful and the server limit is, well, utterly silly. None of that has changed. The nail in the coffin for me was what I considered to be very watered-down gameplay, an opinion cemented by the automated combos.

Yet, due to my Youtube history containing lots of video game and Dragon Ball related material, inevitably a lot of the FZ videos cropped up. Still intrigued, I started watching some of the tournament videos. ""Cool,"" I thought, but didn't reignite my desire to play. Then I watched some of the more instructional videos--beginner tips, frequently made mistakes--and my eyes opened. Suddenly the auto-combos are not only surprisingly easy to counter and scale less in damage than a fully input combo, but catching a player off-guard with a full auto rewards a Dragon Ball. After watching several videos and reading more into the depth of the game's combat, my eyes were opened and I sprung for the game once more.

While I haven't had much opportunity to invest more time in it lately due to my crippling Final Fantasy addiction (and have likely spent more time watching videos than actually playing), I don't regret sticking this in my library, even if it is on the backburner. It most certainly is difficult to master. One day I'll master it.

PROS:
* Deceptively intricate combat. Despite auto combos and strictly quarter-circle inputs, I'm reminded that Smash Bros. is just as simple and had its hooks deep in me. Truly easy to pick up but difficult to master.
* Unique and pinpoint-accurate art style in relation to the anime, right along with stylistic animations and camera movement to go with it.
* Fully voice acted with the original actors and dialogue unique to the game, and unique between characters, both in introductions and in combat.

NEUTRAL:
* Ho-hum story that betrays its own pitch line: ""you, the player, control all the Dragon Ball fighters, and fight other Dragon Ball fighters."" The story takes this *very* literally.

CONS:
* As if the full price tag weren't enough, the DLC character pass costs over half that price.

40596847,english,"I enjoy this game. It has very beautiful visuals. The animations are very crisp and clean. The flow of battle often feels very satisfying. The voice acting is great despite the english dub not matching the animations very well at all. The japanese track is spot on however.

The current roster leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion. There are character choices i question, which seems to be a common occurance in fighting game rosters these days. I mean Nappa? Why? But with Bardock and Broly coming up, I am hopeful that the roster gets a lot more exciting.

I will say that the combo system rubs me in ways both good and bad. Personally I enjoy the harder comboing mechanics of older fighters, but I can see the appeal of this system. I do hope it does not become the norm however. I haven't played around long enough to see just how advanced combos can become without stringing auto combos, but I am sure you can pull off some pretty epic stuff.

I do enjoy the assist system very much. I find the computer and online players have found amazing ways to extend combos and punish me with them, something I am not very good at, but that adds a ton of excitment and dread into my battles. I look forward to playing with them more.

I enjoy the music fully. I do wish there were more stages to fight in though. I don't have too many hours in game, but already I find the stages to feel a bit old and tired. I can't help but feel a little annoyed when I am on the stages select and have to see West City, or West City Destroyed, Planet Namek, or Planet Namek Destroyed, This stage Noon, or This Stage Evening. Pshhh. Boring. I would love for there to be a stage DLC in the future. 

I watched DBZ as a kid, and I forgot, if I ever even really noticed, just how few female fighters there were throughout the show. If I am remembering right, you really only have Android 18, and the new Android 21. Damn, you don't even have a normal female fighter, they got to be androids, that too I just noticed. Not a big deal, but compared to some other anime style fighters, this one is pretty male gender dominate.

Move sets are small, but given the 3 party teams, I don't find this to be a bad thing. It would be nice to have more moves for characters, but I don't think it is really needed, save for maybe Teen Gohan. He seems to be pretty lacking in my eyes. 

Overall though, I would have to recommend this game. It is smooth and enjoyable, and if you are a fan of Dragonball, you can't help but to love it deeply in some way. With DLC and many mechanics that made other fighters before it great, I think the game has a bright future, and hope to see a second installment.",1520295854,1520295854,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,32,3,6293,0,1844,1562466116

The mechanics are simple enough to learn, even for beginners, and a basic combo ending with a super attack is available to every character just from hitting one button over and over, though this doesn't mean longer strings are impossible, or that no skill is required. It just means even new players can pull off a basic string of attacks no problem. The game also looks phenomenal, and every attack and effect looks beautiful. The 3v3 system of battling allows for a wide variety of choice in teams and assists, and the ability to combo into a switch, as well as launch multiple level 3 attacks at once, means players are able to really mix their strategy up. The story is also really well done, and finally gives DB fans something more than just playing through Raditz to Kid Buu again, and Android 21 is a very interesting character with a variety of...

Yes, the online can be fine sometimes but randomly getting kicked out of matches and having to reconnect to lobbies gets annoying. Also party arena matches are nearly unplayable because if even one person has a bad connection then the whole game will drop frames.

So the only people I can recomend it to are those who are new to fighting games but for whatever reason want to learn them. Here is a short summary of what to expect if you are that type of player:

-You will spend dozens of hours in training mode trying to perfect a combo, then you will go online and get rekt.
-You will continue to get rekt untill you learn some neutral and then you wont get rekt as hard
-Then you might win a game against a scrub who mashes auto combo and it will feel good. So good in fact that you might start enjoying this game (50 hours in).
-Then you will continue to train for hours on end and might become an average fighting game player.
-Then you will hit a wall: where you dont know anymore what to improve in your game but there are still plenty of people online consistently reking you
-Then you start drinking and contemplating suicide
-Your wife leaves you and your kids want nothing to do with you
-You'll start coming to local fgc meetups in hopes of getting better and to get that rush from winning

Quite honestly I knew I was going to like this game before it even came out. When I was younger I played Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighters a lot. I also grew up watching Dragon Ball, so the combination of the two made this one of my favorite games. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
1. The Graphics
I cannot stress enough how beautiful this game really is. From the intros of your favorite Dragon Ball characters, to the super attacks, the dramatic finishes, and even how the stage itself can change from its destruction, to a complete change of scene. At points of the game I forget that I'm actually playing and it feels like I'm watching the anime all over again, and it provides a sense of nostalgia.

2. The satisfaction
Nothing is more satisfying in this game to me than winning a very close battle with a destructive finish, it makes all of the hard work and concentration you have seem so worth it. The dramatic finishes also so satisfying to see your enemy get completely obliterated and vaporized out of existence. 

3. The lore and interactions
As I have mentioned before I have watched Dragon Ball all through my life and I have loved every second of it (Yes even with GT even though it was awful) and being able to relive those moments after you do certain tasks to beat your opponent. My favorite character of all time is Dragon Ball Z Trunks, and being able to relive the moment where he kills frieza feels so nice and reminds me why I love this game so much. The unique interactions between the character shows the strong riveralys, to the brothership of characters, and even has a bit of humor like when Trunks asks Krillin if he really married Android 18.

4. Playing with and against Friends
Sadly there is no Co-Op Story mode (and yes I understand that would be hard and tedious) this game is still a SHIT ton of fun to play with friends. My personal favorite is the 3v3 mode where six of your friends can get together and control one person each. It brings a more competitive scene between friends, and I wish you could do this in matchmaking. 

5. The Story
Although, some people didn't enjoy the story as much as they thought they would I still found it so interesting and had a lot of fun. I loved how unique it was to make you not only collect your characters, but do the story not only as the Heroes, but the Villains too. The introduction of Android 21 was also a good idea in my opinion, but not just making her a villain but sorta like Majin Buu where he is evil at first, but a part of them becomes good.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
1. Controles 
Although, I find this game amazing and well developed, not having a controller in this game sucks completely. In my first few hours of playing this game I used the keyboard functions because I couldn't find my old XBox controller and the Micro-USB to plug it in to my computer. The game was still playable with keyboard, but it felt as if all I did was spam buttons and that I didn't understand the game fully making it to where I didn't get the best experience until, I got a controller to work. 


2. The finishers 
Wait, didn't you just say that you enjoyed the finishers? I did and I still love them, but I feel like there should be more finishers for more characters. An example of this would be with the Androids and Trunks. Personally I was looking forward to seeing both the fight with Frieza, and the Androids as a ultimate finisher, or even the fight with Cell after Trunks went back to the future. I know they may be added in the future, or that it takes time to do that, but I would still like to see these added sometime in the future. 

3. The Skins
The main reason I put this as a con was because of two reasons. One I kinda wanted to see multiple forms of Frieza (with them all doing the same damage and having the same stats of course) and the option to switch between Android 17 and 18. Personally I love all the forms of Frieza and the Androids, but just the option to change would make the game even better.

[h1]The Final Review[/h1]
Even with the few cons that I mentioned, I love this game so much. I honestly think that if I wasn't in college and had to do school work every day, I would have over a 1,000 hours on this game already. I can't wait until the new characters and stages (if they are added) come. If you have been thinking about this game, or seen others playing it and wondered if it was good I STRONGLY suggest buying it. Even if you don't like anime the gameplay in itself is fun, exciting, and overall well developed and a great game. I was so hyped to play this game with friends, I even bought a SECOND copy of the game for one of my close friends.
It gets a 11/10 for me, no doubt in my mind.

But I hate the lobby system. It is annoying to wait everytime you log in to first load the lobby you dont want to be in, than change the lobby. Takes like a minute.

This would not be a problem, if you would not get constantly disconected from the lobby. 
Didn´t really had the problem on launch but right now i get disconected every 2 minutes and it is killing me.

40469020,english,"I have been waiting for this game ever since Super Dragon Ball Z on the PS2 made the Budokai series look totally redundant. 

With the splendour of a 2D fighter and the world of Dragon Ball all rolled into one, this game plays very much like Marvel vs. Capcom which along with the source material should be enough to sell this to anyone. Bandai Namco have given us a 2D anime fighter that will keep both the battle-hardened, fightstick flaunting veteran and greenorn button masher entertained for hours. This game offers enough depth for the serious competitor, but also provides an environment where the uninitiated can spend hours and not be tempted to quit through struggling to chain the simplest of combos. 

Fans of the anime will no doubt salivate over 2.5D visuals that, through cel-shade trickery and applied use of low frame rates, throw scenes at the player which look as if they've come straight from the original series and look absolutely stunning on maximum settings. The cast isn't overloaded (there aren't 16 different versions of Goku for you to unlock) but manages to represent series standouts from the early days of DBZ all the way into the current DB Super series. Each character is (fairly) well balanced, with no worries of Yamcha losing outright to Goku Black due to their time of debut on the show. Actually, Yamcha is pretty f**king good here, despite the games included Story Mode taking the same easy swipes at the character that the show's fan community will be used to.

Story Mode itself is a largely fun experience, providing the player with an original story centered around a brand new character designed by the manga's original creator, Akira Toriyama. The battles can become repetitive, but a modest levelling system, plus the incentive of an unlockable character as reward, will make sure this doesn't present much of a grind. 

Sadly, at the time of writing, online is touch and go on the PC version. Having spent 30 hours in game so far, I have managed to connect successfully to 7 matches out of countless attempts to go head to head with other players around the world. The first of at least two patches aiming to remedy this have landed, and hopefully we won't wait long for the situation to change. In the meantime, Local Match mode includes an Arcade Ladder, single player matches and a tournament mode to keep us occupied and exercised. 

Anyone who is a fan of Dragon Ball will have a blast with this game, while anyone with even a passing interest in fighting games would be doing themselves a disservice in not taking this one for a spin.

40463417,english,"Pros: - Very Stylish
- It's DRAGON BALL! Fans of most any itteration have content to enjoy.
- Some variety in play modes
- Good music, entirely devoid of dubstep 
- Good effort with the story mode voice overs and dialog
- Easy to pick up and play at any level
- Every fighter has attacks you would want to see them use. Remember when Gotenks delivered a massive headbutt to Majin Buu?
- XBOX controller support!
- Disconnecting against online opponents too often does come with a penalty

Cons: - SFX (fighter hit noises, dialog and other SFX) are sometimes more annoying than enjoyable. This is true with both JP and ENG voices
- always online DRM
- Easy Anti-Cheat
- Story is far too easy and doesn't make much sense in the dragon ball universe. No difficulty settings.
- Arcade is far too hard
- Netcode isn't great but isn't horrible either. Don't expect to play with accuracy against players outside of your region.
- Timing for some attacks are far too strict while others are far too lenient. Example: after Nappa's 236M you can't even mash his sabiaman. You need to be frame-perfect to continue pressure without an assist. Meanwhile Goku Black and others can score a knockdown, float lazily to the ground, wait for 2-3 seconds and then activate any super and it'll still hit.
- Lack of defenisve options.
- Match timer is also too lenient. Damage output seems a bit too high for some characters and too low for others.
- Some characters are way too easy to play.
- Anti-airs and throws (dragon rushes) seem random too. Sometimes they'll hit no problem, other times they will go into your opponent and not hit (not that you'll notice most of the time with all the chaos going on during a match)
- Consumer censorship (you cannot type to other players, only respond with a pre-set list of replies)
- Premium store is a bit misleading
- no cross-platform

Easy to get in to, hard to master.

and I'm not sure about the master part. The game has a few combos, but like one combo, with a few variations in between, can be executed for almost the entire cast.
When the game first came out every tryhard was playing SSB Vegeta, since he had a stupid combo that was just annoying to fight against. The online is pure crap - you have to choose a lobby to join and then have a limitted number of players being able to join your ringmatches, which results in barely any filled rooms.

-Competitive ranked play is intense and fun.
-Lobby character system feels like club penguin. Cool lobby avatars. Cool player cards.
-Combo system is deep and innovative. 
-the 3v3 team system makes this game feel like a different breed of fighting game.

Cons:
-Story mode is lame. Wish someone would remake the story mode of budokai 3 or even 2. This story mode is basically fighting clones of the 16 characters which becomes almost immediately. Feels like theres nothing worth going back for/ unlocking in story mode ever after unlocking Android 21.
-Lobby system is currently broken. Sometimes getting into a match is instant and other times you get disconnected from lobby 8 times in 20 minutes but they're already talking about fixes for that.
-There aren't any in-fight transformations other than golden frieza and gohan unlocked potential. This is like the cornerstone of dragonball z.... screaming until your hair and muscles get bigger. Same goes for fusions. you can play as gotenks but he's a selectable character.
- Unlockables are kind of meh, it never really feels exciting to spend your zeni because you never get character unlocks or new moves or anything other than avatars and commentators and z-stamps (sticker system)

Overall, this is just a few major thoughts on the game but I would recommend this game to any one that loves fighting games that make your heart race. This is definitely a new breed of fighting game worth trying out.

So finally I decided to buy DB FighterZ. I didn't pre order the game because at first I wouldn't like the game at all. I personally not a fan of slide fighting games like Tekken, Marvel VS Capcom, street fighter etc. So Why did I changed my mind and bought this? Honestly? because I was bored. I don't have my PC mustah race with me atm and not anytime soon I will be able to play with my Beast PC, and because of that I did not pre order FF15 instead I bought this game. My Laptop can't handle games like Final Fantasy 15 but it can run well for DB FighterZ and that's the only reason why I bought the game.

Does it worth the money? Well YES, I would refund the game if my laptop couldn't handle it OR It's not as much fun as I had time playing DBX2. I love the style, the graphic the colors of this game, it feels like I was watching and playing DB Anime. The combo in this game is not my kinda of taste so I had trouble activate the ultimate skill and other combo. I also love the interaction of each character that we will never see it in anime and only in DB FighterZ. It was amusing, funny and entertained. I love Goku and Vegeta fighting who gets to fight Freiza and then he lost his nerve because those two saiyan Monkeys keep backering xDD. 

The final move is very catchy to my eyes, I just love it when I manage to execute the skill buttons and hit the enemy. It feels great when it success. 

I haven't tried playing the Multiplayer, for some reason I could not connect to anyone. It keep giving me server full when I only tried to have a match with a friend. Perhaps the server problem? Hope so.

How's the story? Well personally to me, I love seeing Android 21. She is cute...:P Oh and I played the game in Japanese dub and I love her voice! xDD , Android 21 is a good edition to Dragon Ball, althou She is definetly not a canon character sadly :( cause I love her.

At the time of writing this review; I've put in about 5-6 hours into the game. Large amounts of reveiws are complaining about the server issues and low lobby capacity and since I don't have friends, I'm going to tackle this on a primarily solo experince.

Lets say outright that if you are not a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise; I do not reccomend this game. The game is built for the fans of the series; it looks phenomenal outside the different framerates with the character animation. They look almost frame by frame and it completely breaks immersion for the first two seconds of the match. But if you're a fan of cell shaded art styles; every frame is background quality gorgeous.

The fighting; it's okay. It's not Tekken or Streetfighter. It's not extremely deep and brain breaking. It's casual friendly and looks amazing, while simultaneously being fun and engaging. The name of the game is timing, timing your pre-determinded combos with assists and super attcks is the entire game. I'd reccomend going through the practice mode at the beginning so you can blast through story fights and arcade. The game also has a manual combo system where you can string your own combos together if they have a certain order (this may be wrong, but I don't understand it very much) I'd reccomend playing the combo challenges for your favorite characters for practice on timing.

Before I touch on the story; the hub world. It sucks. The warp mechanic (L2) is the only reason I can forgive it. I'm currently about a third through it. (SPOILERS: The game is set up in three arcs, all of which revolves around a singular story from different perspectives and slight different changes.) It's not well written but fan-service makes its debut again and makes the iffy dialogue suprisingly nostalgic. The villian is my favorite part of the story; Android 21 is extremely interesting and stupidly over the top. She's worth the price alone if on sale.

8/10 for Dragon Ball fans
7/10 for a fighting game

Update: I've played more FighterZ quite a bit more than when I wrote this. I said that I didn't understand the manual combo system.

As almost every recent game now days the servers are not really good right now and players are able to quit in the middle of a Ranked Match without any penalization. As it is right now, until any fix in the servers I highly recommend not playing ranked but that's the only flaw I can see right now, overall the game as a whole is really good. Beautiful and nostalgic art-style, fast-paced combat, really simple for such a nice fighting game, does not matter if you're a casual player or a competitive player; either way you'll love this game and as a competitive player in fight games I can tell you, the mechanics are as simple and good as the original Budokai for PS2 but you can totally master them! I cannot stop recommending this game, if you want a new fighting game this is a must have.
And every Character is playable and the God Emperor Yamcha is top tier right now.

This game is beautiful and you will be in awe of how accurate this game is to the manga/anime. Its great for anyone that loves fighting games or just Dragon Ball Z, and I mean EVERYONE. This game sets it up perfectly for anyone that isnt good in fighting games with an easy tutorial, and auto combos to assist you in battle. The game offers a Story, Arcade, Local Tournament, Practice/Tutorial and Online mode. Everything you need for a fighting game.

The gameplay which is key for a fighting game is good. It isnt the best thing but it entertains and has skill gaps in it. You'll tell if someone is using auto combos or acutal combos in this game. With Air combos, Assists, DHC, and OTGs it will be familiar if you have ever played a Marvel vs Capcom game. 

The Sound and Graphics are great. It feels your are actually invovled with the anime/manga with the same sound effects, the same animations and such. ArcSys really got their research on this game. Matter of fact, in certain situations you can trigger actual moments in the show/manga. From Goku turning Super Sayain, to the defeat of Kid Buu with the spirit Ball.

The story mode is cool but this mode also is...tedious to say. It has a cool idea on how to progress but I didnt like the story that much and its REALLY long. You will put in 15-20 hours in the story alone, especially if you try to get evey cutscene done. Still, you'll get some laughs as they talk about a lot of ""what ifs"" and such.

40360996,english,"I'm going to be one of the few naysayers here also.  The game is good on some levels and REALLY annoying on others,  The positive reviews do a fair job of hitting on what works.  Here's what doesn't:

The lobby system is REALLY lame.  The only way to communicate is with emotes and an existing set of canned phrases like ""good fight"".  

Unless you have 100mbps fiber optic internet like me, the online mode can be slow and occasionally disconnect.

The music is extremely tedious and repetative, barely soundling like anything from any of the dragonball shows, or at least maybe a bad knock off put together by a middle school music student on a synthesizer.

My BIG gripe with the game is it's claim of being newbie friendly.  What most of the hurried early reviews missed is that the game quickly become very newbie hostile about 1/2 to 2/3 way thru the story or arcade modes.  Opponents will start stringing extremely difficult to block or counter chains of super combos and assists.  The final fight with the evil version of Andriod 21 (story mode) is so cheap as to defy description.  It makes anything King of Fighters (or any other fighting game) look like a gimme by comparison.  Not just sour grapes here either.  I'm a VERY casual fighting game player.  Better than a newbie but FAR FAR from being an esports competitor.  I had 174 fights total in story mode,  151 I won.  Only TWO of those losses were on the way to the final fight.   The other 21 were the final fight.

Needless to say 152 fights over 3 arcs makes for a gawdawful LONG story mode too.

I also don't like only having the option of 3 on 3 team fights.  1 on 1 and 2 on 2 should have been included as options.

Controls tend to be randomly wonky too.

40353470,english,"Just a small background about my exposure to fighting genre throughout my life. As a child, I used to love games such as Marvel vs Capcom 2 and Tekken 5 (Dark Resurrection on PSP to be exact) but I never was efficient at any fighting game I have ever played during that time, just merely button mashing and all for fun. I pretty much gave up on the genre soon after because I saw myself never improving after couple of online matches, although I don't remember which game was the last one for me. Years have passed until I pretty much touched a fighting game one more time and it was just Tekken 7 as a start. The game that actually got me to understand FGC terminology and etc well enough, along with making me develop my competence within the genre was Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator (Rev 2 to be exact). It was a very complex game but thanks to its tutorial along with an experienced friend's match-ups, I have been slowly getting used to it while preparing myself for the hype of DBFZ.

After more than 50 hours and having Super Saiyan rank at the time of this review was written, I am absolutely glad that I have returned to this genre, as I found a game that might someday surpass my play-time for Tekken DR. However, the game has its problems like all others (few are quite serious but ArcSys/Bandai established that they are aiming to fix them).

DBFZ is one of the easier fighting games in the market, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a good amount of depth into it. ""Easy to learn but hard to master"" saying can work with it but it still ain't as hard as games like Guilty Gear for example, but its mechanics work wonders in its favor. I initially thought auto-combos would be a major inconvenience while trying to learn manual/BnB combos but actually after playing for a good amount, there are times that auto-combos actually help, especially on air as it has its own properties while it helps to track the distance between you and your opponent, and stuff like that. It is discouraged to just rely on only auto-combos though as people could tell where to block each time and would easily find an opening to punish you for relying on that tactic, along with always superdashing. There is no such thing as ""uncounterable attack"". Some might be harder than others to deal with but they have their own weaknesses/openings that you can exploit against them and when you find them out, it will feel good. It is also important to note that the inputs in DBFZ are extremely easy, as most of them are quarter-circle turns with nothing complex to worry about. ArcSys did a splendid job in balancing both simplicity and depth within this game.

The story mode, while being genuinely fun as you watch characters interacting each other and watching the cutscenes as their own, is a huge grind borefest unfortunately. You keep fighting brain-dead clones which offer no challenge (however I have not tried hard mode of the story) and the boss characters are meh as well when it comes to difficulty (again though, never tried hard mode yet). Arcade offers a degree of enjoyment as the difficulty slowly ramps up but it has its own severe difficulty spike as opponents gain more buffs and could easily kill you if it ever detects you having an opening, which can be unfair especially to people who want to unlock SSB forms of Goku and Vegeta in hard mode versions of the arcade runs. It is a bit disappointing but it can help waste some time while trying to find matches or you just want to do something quickly.

Now to an important part, which is the online infrastructure of DBFZ as this is where my main complaints will be in. I keep getting disconnected from lobby in an inconsistent manner and it could even disconnect me from couple of matches (one or two of them would make it seem like I rage-quit while I haven't. I actually enjoy getting bodied by better players and try to learn from that) and I find myself getting properly connected to less matches than the ones I managed to find and accept. I had much more favorable experience in Guilty Gear but to be fair, DBFZ is a much more popular game which has a lot more people playing it, so the servers could be strained... but it has been like a month and nothing has changed so far. Disconnections still occur numerous times, ring/party matches are still broken as I rely on Steam download region method, and inconsistent match connections as there are times I could play with the same person and other times it suddenly brings an odd error like ""EAC Disconnected: Peer Untrusted"". I assume it is the anti-cheat but it is highly unreliable when it comes to potentially detecting an actual cheater. I seriously hope ArcSys/Bandai will fix them soon as they promised in their latest road-map video (Highly appreciate the open communication for that by the way).

The game is a huge blast and makes me happy that I gave this genre one more chance while trying to be a more competent player in it, especially that I have been getting back to Dragon Ball hype (DBS will be over soon unfortunately) while remembering the times playing prominent DB games like Budokai 3 and Budokai Tenkaichi 3 on PS2. It is also important to note that my last purchased and played DB game was Burst Limit. I have never been interested in any DB game after that besides probably Xenoverse series but I never got interested enough to actually try it out. DBFZ was the first one to get me extremely excited and I am very glad it hasn't disappointed gameplay-wise. It only needs to get its online servers/infrastructure to be fixed and it will be an even better game that I could highly recommend (however I still do heavily recommend this game thanks to the love, care, and attention the developers have put into it).

So far gameplay-wise I would most defintely recommend this game. However, the PC port of this game is in desperate need of some polishing. I get constant crashes during story mode ( most recently right after the final cutscene of the android 21 arc), the audio can be iffy at times, and for some reason you can't use a Xbox and ps4 controller in tandem for local splitscreen. It has to be 2 of the same type in case anyone else is having this problem. Other than some less than polished features I'd say the game is great.

40331750,english,"I've played alot of Dragon Ball Fighting games. This one offers some nice stuff in comparison to the others but also falls short in certain areas.

Let's start with the pro's:

- Great graphics and art style. Really makes you feel like you're playing the anime.
- Every attack you do feels like it hurts your opponent, which is a lot of fun.
- Story is a good as you can expect from a dragonball game. There's some funny stuff in the cutscenes.
- The Arcade mode on Hard is really difficult, which is awesome. I hate easy to beat CPU opponents.
- Switching between characters and using combo's during combat adds a nice layer of gameplay.

con's:

- The Character Roster. Without any DLC the game contains 24 playable characters. This is a very sad number. Even with upcoming DLC (8 extra c's) it's still only 32. Compare that too Xenoverse (46) or Xenoverse 2 (78) without DLC and I get the feeling I bought half a game for full price.

- The Controls. I'm almost never able to perform an 'ultimate' attack when I want. The combination you need to pull of for such an attack is weird and more often then not I fail at it. (could also be that I'm a noob)

- Lack of transformations. The game lacks the feature to transform characters in combat. Transformations are temporary during an attack (like Goku going SSJ 3 during an ultimate attack). I don't like this.

- Lack of attacks. No Galick Gun for Vegeta. No Spirit Bomb for Goku

Dragon Ball FighterZ is a refreshing take on the 3v3 fighting game style that we've fallen in love in from previous games like Marvel VS Capcom. The game succeeds both in casual and competitive modes. There are many offline modes to play like Story, Arcade, Practice, Locals, and Tournament mode. Visually the game is stunning, and the music and voice work complements the game very well. Combat is both enjoyable and rewarding, feeling natural and beginner friendly. The starting cast is a good size filled with classic and newer characters from the animated series.

- matching system is by far the worst ever and unable to match you with sort of equal opponents, even if there is an option to just search for opponents on ~same level. Winratio does not matter to the game, so this option makes no sense, cause it jist does not work.

- worst part is you are forced always to fight 3 v 3 , there is not even an option to go for a decent 1 v 1 (very lame !)
- that makes the fights all really messy with an overload of special effects  
(looks very nice first, but gets annoying pretty soon)
- matches are way too soon over, the characters can´t take much before going K.O. (lame !)

- soundtrack sucks hardcore, original themes will follow by DLC, but without the best ones (pathetic !)

39740913,english,"I wanted a new, decent fighter with a heavy focus on combos and multiple characters per fight à la Skullgirls/mvc/kof starring draginbollz characters and guess what, my wish got granted. Thanks Shenron!

[b]But is it good? You bet it is![/b]

+ Gorgeous visuals with the state-of-the-art team red rendering pipeline for characters (look at their GDC guilty gear conference for more detail, crazy use of UV mapping!) which looks INSANELY GOOD on dragon ball characters!
Crazy simple technically yet crazy beautiful effects with generous feedback for every attack and supers all over the place! (7 meter levels and you can DHC (cancel supers into other character supers) allowing for super flashy displays and finishers!

+ Decent content with a cool story mode and a good amount of base playable characters.

+ Super fast-paced gameplay with easy to perform combos (in general, not just autocombos which are pretty bad given they pop out a dragon ball, have meh/ok-ish damage and end up in a soft knockdown).

+ Some characters have really great gameplay. Nappa is a juggernaut/hulk that uses saibaimen with their own AI (cf: Jack-O from GG) for pressure, Beerus can ricochet his projectiles with every attack, Tien/c16 have crazy one-time lv3's, and ginyu can use his signature move! Yes He can swap with the opposing character (and also heavily gimp him because he can't use his squad moves!), making him viable despite his weakness! Also Yamcha is super, SUPER strong!


[b]It does have its downsides, though[/b]:

- Expensive ! Base pricing at launch is 60 bucks + 35 for the season pass making it reach almost 100€$ if you want to have all characters! Arcsys as a whole seems to become greedy lately, with blazblue crosstag battle having half of it's cast being DLC and 4 season passes, this is bad!

- The game ""menu"" is basically guilty gear xrd rev2's online lobby mode: You move around as a chibi in an ONLINE hub world. Although this one is well made, quirky and ergonomic enough, serverside lags could ruin your experience. I might not have encountered annoying latency yet but I have heard people complain about it a lot so be careful about this.


[b]So should you buy it? If you love dragon ball, are into fighting games (especially combo-heavy ones) or just love games that are the embodiment of Michael Bay, yes by all means get it[/b] (and if you are cautious about the aforementioned downsides, play the waiting game or get it during a sale!

40258568,english,"I still believe Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 to be the superior and more deep game, with an amazing visual and music style (probably the best fighting game cureently on steam and consoles) but it is only natural that ASW hits another homerun, adding one more stylized anime fighter to their impressive resume. 

Amazing visuals, high speed intense battles featuring your favorite childhood characters screaming their lungs out and the revival of the 3vs3 mechanics make this the perfect chaotic competitive.. party game! This polished fighter is definitely worth your attention, with a presentation that aims to satisfy everyone, from the most casual player to the most hardcore and for most of the time it succeeds.

Of course not everything is roses, as i feel that the single player modes are a bit lacking when you compare ASW previous efforts, with a serviceable arcade mode that unfortunately just offers an array of battles withour specific bosses or endings and a story mode that while is fun (with some customization and plenty of interactions)feels a bit repetitive and uninspired at certain points. But still, the content is surely going to keep you occupied for some time especially if you wnat to unlock the higher difficulties. 

The onine system is also a bit marred by some qustionable choices such as the confusing lobby/friend invitation system but I guess that's the price when you try to be a bit more creative! The online experience is most of the time fine, netcode works quite well although persoally i sometimes have difficulty to locate matches and not sure why. But when i do, it's certainly a blast. 

Minor complaint is that the roster starts to feel a bit small after a while but that will improve with the implementation of addtional DLC characters, for better or worse. But bonus points for featurng some ""old school"" unlocks for not one but three additional characters already on the base game without the need to spend a single dime, along with a ton of cosmetics for lobby avatars, character colors and other small goodies, all completely free.

One of the most enjoyable experiences that allows you to do some pretty impressive comebacks with crazy cinematic supers, Dragonball FighterZ is one of the best games to add to your library if you are a fighting game fan and of course if you love DBZ.

40237884,english,"As someone who doesn't buy a lot of games especially with a lot of them I usually get on sale, this is very rare for me to say this.  At the full price of $60, Dragon Ball FighterZ is totally worth it as you will be getting your money's worth.  The fighting mechanics are very fluid and solidly smooth.  The graphics are the perfect mixture of the old-school arcade style and contemporary cel-shading to be as faithful as possible to the anime.  I loved Dragon Ball FighterZ and this excellent title has very simple, but very stunning gameplay that will hook you for many hours to come.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is the roster.  Dragon Ball FighterZ truly delivered the passion of the Dragon Ball franchise by offering 24 distinctively iconic characters that feel truly their own.  The roster may be less than Xenoverse 2, but the quality over quantity is a step in the right direction for Bandai by its turn of more intricately distinct moves from each character.  The storymode of Android 21 is an interesting look at an original story that takes an even bigger risk than the past two Xenoverse games, but nails it as a new DBZ game exactly should.  Instead of being responsible to not alter the timeline, we are introduced into an entirely new one.  This is a great change of pace because we don't have to see the same exact story retold from the anime countless of times to death like we did since the first Budokai game.  Another change that is finally perfected is the RPG element.  Although I appreciate Xenoverse's attempt at making the DBZ experience your own by giving you the option to customize your own character, I feel as though the game distanced itself too much as it didn't feel like a DBZ game.  Instead, it felt like a generically bland RPG with being surrounded by DBZ characters and not feeling like an authentic Dragon Ball Z game.  In Dragon Ball FighterZ, you get to utilize your favorite DBZ heroes of leveling them up and using experience boosters which makes the RPG experience feels a lot more solid and compact as well as having your own avatar to navigate the lobbies with.  The online servers feel much more tighter and organized if you want to play with others.

40213746,english,"PROS

1. The models and animations are crazy good.

Nuff' said.

2. Respect for Dragonball fandom.

The character's movesets are 1:1 with their manga counterparts. You can tell parts of this game were made by people who are DBZ fans. My favorite character is Trunks and you guys nailed him.

3. Each match feel like an episode of DBZ

Other features of the game are lacking, but the gameplay feels like an episode of DBZ. It feels rewarding to mix and match teams, learn combos, and execute them. Everything flows so well.

CONS

1. Lobby system is a cesspool of poor UX decisions.

I have to start the game, login, wait for a million loading screens and then walk my avatar all the way over to the 'Online Arena' NPC and then walk all the way over to the 'Training NPC'. The only reason the lobby system exists to further gamify features outside of game play e.g. avatars, emotes, etc... It's just poorly executed and feels worthless. 

2. You can't stay in an online match long enough to enioy it. 

I wish I could count the number of times I've gotten disconnected during a good match. The net code seems to be pretty stable, but you get random disconnects once every other match. Nothing makes me want to throw my controller at the screen more than when I disconnect from a match.

If you want to play this game to play against other people online, don't. 

3. The story mode is stale.

I wish I could unlock Android 21 some other way, but instead I have to grind through a really boring story mode. 


CONCLUSION:

In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. Because I am mostly competitive, the cons far outweigh the pros. Once I complete the story and arcade modes, I want to test my mettle online. I want to combo people's faces off. I can't do that right now because I can't stay in a match. Please fix the disconnecting issues and that will be a great first step in allowing people to enjoy online competitive play.

The netcode isn't great. I mean, it's not bad. I've lived through worse. And I'm sure that this netcode is great for places like Japan, with it's high population density.

Well, it matters because this game marks ArcSys's first real push into the modern north american marketplace. They're big boys now. And in big boy world, a fighting game IS the netcode.

First, if you are not a Dragon Ball Z fan, you will enjoy this game far less than someone who is. A lot of the reward of playing this game comes from its fan service. You will find many character interactions, cut scenes, and dialog that is based entirely on past events that took place in the TV shows, or Manga. If you are someone who has not seen them, Its going to be off beat and confusing.

This game does stand on its own as fighting game. What truly sets it apart is its accommodation to all skill levels. This game finds the perfect balance for all skill levels. Weather you are brand new to fighting games, or are a  fighting game expert, you can enjoy this game. It has simplistic single button combos that are both visually satisfying, and easy to execute, but also embraces a multi layered combo system similar to Marvel Vs Capcom 2. Its also filled with techs like air dashes, parries, teleport  and counters. This makes the game playable for people on every level of skill. 

a word of caution... If you are looking to play online with other players. You will NEED to get some experience before you start winning, as people online are way better than any computer you can face. 

Visually this game is amazing. All moves are visually astounding, and feel tailored to the characters.   Destructive finisher, and dramatic Finishes are over the top endings where a character will be  kicked through a mountain or building, or it will reenact a scene from the anime if a certain criteria is meet during the match. They all are very satisfying to watch, and visually feel very powerful. The combos and moves fit perfectly . All the punches and kicks seemed to be pulled right from the anime. In some ways it's like your in the Anime.

If you are a diehard Dragon Ball fan you will definitely want to get this game. It’s the best Dragon Ball game that has ever been produced.

Aside from that, the netcode is really good even if it is delayed based, although there should be a better punishing system for ragequitters and the server infrastructure and online system in general could use some upgrades, the lobby system is cute and all but it is 2018 c'mon, let me invite my friends directly to matches instead of having to go to a exact lobby and setting up a ring match for example.

Finally one must really commend the hard work and love that has been put in this game, Arcsystems works really outdone themselves showing a lot of respect to the legacy of the franchise, almost every single frame of animation is a reference to the show/manga, and the way it is presented is absolute nuts, so all in all bravo to the developers as it shows an outstanding level of polish and care for the product.

40164039,english,"Well. I have mixed feelings for the price I paid for ( Fighter Z Edition, 130 CAN $ )
----
The game itself is very fun. The speed, animations and effects makes the game very enjoyable. 
All I can say about it is once you touch it, You wont be able to go back to the other DBZ Games easyly. It's great.
Character wise: Everyone feels rather ""Unique"". I mean, The game has Auto combos (Press Light attack multiple time to chain Light-Medium-Heavy. If you keep pressing, you'll do a chase and do Airbone Light-Medium-Heavy again.) Wich does make me feel like the characters sorta plays the same, but with different gimicks and special abilities.
In a way, it's both a good and a bad thing. Good as, You can easyly switch characters in your team and do your normal stuff on them, but you wont have the full knowledge and extend of their specials if you didnt trained with them a little bit.  You realy have to be open to little details while trying out characters and see wich you prefer based on your game style.

Single player content? You have Story mode, Arcade mode, Local fights ...  Yeah that's about it.
There's also a TONS of unlockables that you can earn by doing fights, wich earns you Zenis that you can spend on capsules to get Lobby avatars, Things to customise your Fighter card and some alternative colors (6 for each character to unlock, doh they are the same color palette for everyone.) And Z-Stamps. Sorta like Stickers you can show off in the lobby along with some lines to make custom messages. (For exemple: Putting a Z-stamp of a very Pissed off Nappa with the caption ""No way!"" under it.)

SO YEAH.

NOW FOR THE POINTS I DONT LIKE.

The online matchmaking. ""Set me up with someone of my level."" Yet I keep getting set up with peoples that are way more wins and matches under their belt that I do. Heck, Even 2-3 ranks over me at some points. This happens Mostely in ranked.
Defensive options Feels limited. If you get in a corner, You'll get spammed by light attacks and mixups with high and low attacks and the few ways to get out of it, is to punish a blocked heavy move, Teleport in your opponent's back, Randomly throw out a level 1 Super that has hit invincibility at the start... you can also try reflecting, but good luck landing a move that takes 30 frames to come out when most of the cast light/mediums comes out un less than 7-10 frames. :^)

Oh. and switching characters. When you swich characters, they are forced into the super dash animation toward the enemy. If they block it or see it comming, it's a free punish. It's also VERY easy to intercept, specialy since you come from across the screen, leaving them plenty of time to do a special or a heavy attack.

...Speaking of switching characters, I also hate a few things about it:
1: Quick switching is bound to Foward + Assist. When you want to use an assist while dashing, You cant. You'll just switch by accident and get your ass kicked. :V
2: While blocking, Switching characters is impossible. You need a certain window  of time to even be able to switch characters, Wich makes your defense options even more limited when you want to pull out a dying character but cant afford to let your guard down.
3: If you dont hold your Assist button long enough during blocking to try to switch character, the Assist will pop up instead and leave you in a 10 second wait before being able to switch characters.
This happens to me so many times. It's upsetting :V


So yeah.

Game is fun, Frustrating as fuck doh.

40141459,english,"This has been my first fighting game that I took seriously past playing casually with friends and I must say it's impressive how much it's changed my opinion of fighting games. Before I was not much of a fan because I felt that they were too hard to get into. But this game is sort of an ""entry level"" fighting game, it will allow you to focus more on your movement and positioning in the beginning with auto combos where you just have to press the same button a few times and it performs a short combo while you focus more on finding the opening on the enemy instead of performing some complicated combo that you can't be expected to implement very early on if you're new to fighting games. 

Because of this the game is very easy to pick up and atleast give a shot if you don't like fighting games. While still being very easy to get into it can become very complex as you improve but the game will let you do that at your own pace giving you breathing room as you don't have to spend your early hours of the game trying to learn a combo before you even know how to find an opening and hit the combo on an enemy. The online community has made it even easier to learn as they will post tech and combo tutorials online (I specifically look on the subreddit which has hundreds of helpful players willing to answer the most basic of questions.) The community has been great on introducing newcomers such as myself to the game as it has one of the (if not the) largest pc release of a fighting game. 

Though the game is not without it's flaws just yet. The servers may disconnect you sometimes but with a solid wired connection I've only been dropped from games 2 times in my play time. The single player is also very very weak currently. I believe it is rumored that more modes will be added later but currently for single player modes you have the practice, the story, and arcade. Practice is just as any other fighting game, nothing to complain about here, it's actually quite nice and gives you lots of options based on what you want to practice. The story however is not good to put it bluntly. If you're a Dragon Ball fan the story is mainly there to teach you the controls and give you nice character interactions in the cutscenes. Other than that don't expect too much. Arcade is also very weird, in most fighting games higher difficulty would mean that the ai reacts better and punishes harder but in the harder arcade modes (which are not available right off the bat and will require you to beat the normal version of that arcade map) are downright BS. Making the Ai do more damage and take less while pumping out supers that do ridiculous amounts of damage. Thankfully that is not the main focus of the game. As it is like other fighting games where the main focus is on online ranked play. Which while others have had many problems I haven't encountered many at all. Maybe a laggy match or two but it was because of an opponents wireless connection.

The games graphics are also top notch and fit the style of Dragon Ball incredibly well. Animations are easy to read and tell what attack is being thrown at you for the most part and allows an easier time at learning how to block attack strings. If you have below the recommended specs for the game it's still worth trying and turning all of the settings down because the lowest settings look nearly like a PSP or DS game which should allow most of anything to run it. It is also moddable which allows for custom skins and music while still being allowed to play online!

TL;DR
This game is a satisfying and accessible game to someone that's never even touched a fighting game. It will take commitment and time to learn and to get good at but it's well worth it as finally being able to pull off your combo you worked on for a while in a ranked match. The graphics and details are wonderful and really fill out the fact that this is a Dragon Ball game. While it has it's flaws the main problems lie in the modes that aren't really much of a focus and you really won't worry about after the beginning of playing. It is well worth the money and probably one of my favorite games right now.

+ It has an, easy to pick up-hard to master, fighting system. 
+ Good soundtrack variety.
+ Decent amount of characters (DLC excluded). 
+ Amazing graphics, it's pretty much eye candy. 
+ Fun story line, really you just play it for the interactions between the characters you have in your group. 
+ No microtransactions (can't believe that we're at a point where we have to actually address this). 
+ Arcade, local, ranked, casual and a practice mode with many tools for the more competitive players. 
+ Lots of fan service and call back to the show for the fans. 

- Although not often, I do sometimes get disconnected from the lobby. 
- There is currently no punishment for rage quitters apart from making their name purple, as if that's going to change anything. 
- The coloured square infront of your name indicating your ranking is affected by casual matches, making the term ""casual"" lose its meaning.  

Overall, this is one of, if not the best dragonball game ever made, doing justice to series while also serving as a superb 2D fighting game for any fan of the genre.

The long story short of this game is that the foundation for the combat is good and overall solid.  There isn't much variety to combos/approaches, nor is there much reason to when the most simple of combos can do 40 - 50 percent health.  It is also a very pretty game, but the content is poor quality, and the online setup is so shitty you can't easily play with a friend without a lot of effort.  


- Online is shit and not worth the hassle.  It doesn't allow for private matchmaking which is lame as hell if you want to setup things with your friends.  You can create ring matches with passwords which are within lobbies, but you can't invite people to them...Also, your buddies have to physically locate you in the game.  This is probably my biggest issue with the game.
- In addition to the above, the game's popularity took Arc Systems off guard so the amount of lobbies are hurting people's ability to play online in a lot of countries/regions, further hitting on the issues above.
- No transformation system/installs (like Budokai games, or characters in MvC games like how Dante and Vergil had Devil Trigger, Ryu, Awakening, etc.,) for the Saiyans outside of Adult Gohan's potential unleashed super, and Frieza's Golden Frieza).  You can only watch them transform in the intro, or as part of a super animation.  It hurts me on the fan-service side of things
- No flight mechanics.  I understand this is a 2D traditional fighter (which I love), but at least they could've given flight to the characters like they do for characters in the Marvel vs Capcom games.
- Story mode may drag out for some folks and get tedious fighting the same few mook clones over and over with braindead AI regardless of the difficulty setting until like the very end of the game where they move.
- Arcade mode AI gets stat buffs on the difficult routes.  I don't mind it too much, but most would consider it a lame way of making it difficult vs just making the AI smarter/using more difficult to handle setups.
- No Arcade endings.  Doesn't bother me with this game honestly since arcade endings only really mattered to me if there wasn't a story like most fighting games in the past, but for traditional fighting game fans it may.    
- While gameplay has a lot of depth and is fun, the movelists having a lack of  command normals, specials, varying combo routes, and things you can do in general in comparison to MvC, Skullgirls, and many other fighters similar to this type, especially without assists is a little on the low side.There are videos out there with people doing awesome things like Clayton's stuff from SRK, but damn is it a bit dull at times in comparison.
- Challenges consist mainly of auto combos up until the last 2 or 3 generally (8-10) and even the final challenges don't do much in providing you something useful to make a gameplan out of like other fighters.  You'll want to do some experimenting in training mode on your own or finding videos online to set yourself up to get better if you don't have much experience with 2D fighters.  
- There is a decent amount of content. Story mode that has RPG style stats mixed with a board game thing with various routes for fights and such and a shit ton of grinding that can quickly become a drag.  The AI that's braindead until like the final arc of the story is lame  There are also challenges, the tutorial, and goodies like colors to unlock for the cast, but colors are locked under a loot box type of thing that you buy from the game shop, challenges are mainly doing auto combos up into the last 2-3 challenges, and don't really have anything useful..  Overall, the content is poor quality personally speaking.

That's pretty much where the bulk of my thoughts are with the game.

when you play hard more Arcade the AI goes from ""online practice"" to ""f*ck you for playing our game"" as the game will not let you swap characters be cause it wants you to have less characters, and will just outright IGNORE your commands which I think was done to have people pay for the SSB unlocks

39756080,english,"As a dragon ball fan, this game is a wet dream. It looks, feels, and sounds absolutely amazing. The effort that went into this aspect of the game is incredible, as well as the story mode having around 3 hours of cutscenes, many of them fun interactions between your favorite dragon ball characters. The characters feel amazing and their movesets are perfect, bringing out the best of every saga of dragon ball z.
Where this game starts to fall short for me is the actual fighting game behind it. Its designed as a hyper fighting game where you play with 3 characters, very similar to MvC3. However this game, unlike MvC, is made to be very friendly to new players. This was necessary, as the audience for this game is massive, and many of them don't know the first thing about fighting games. The game is programmed so that if you just mash any of the attack buttons, you will do a guaranteed target combo, many of them ending in supers. Although the game gives you many options to do manual combos, unless you are extending them to great lengths, they do just about as much if not less than the target combos. The game also gives you a large amount of movement options, specifically the chase mechanic, in which you fly forward surrounded by energy, classic dragon ball style. The implementation of this mechanic, as well as the one bar instant transmission counter, will make this game absolute hell for any new player not familiar with fighting games. The chase also tracks opponents, and in the air can sometime result in free cross ups. This, plus the large array of beam attacks and assists really water down the actual fighting in this game. Also unlike MvC, this game is lacking an advancing guard, making enemies much more likely to zone you out. Although they do try to make up for this with a reflect mechanic, its lackluster at best and has almost no practical capabilities, minus negating beam attack damage. In my mind, this game does not give you the motivation to want to improve.

Although i said i do not recommend this game, its split 50/50 for me.
If you like Dragon Ball Z, you'll like this game. Just don't try to hop online, it will most likely just enrage you, as the community for this game right now is absolutely apalling.
If you're trying to get into fighting games by learning this one, its a bad place to start. There's no other fighting game like this one, and although learning manual combos will definitely give you a boost, overall you'll likely feel no sense of improvement for a very long time.
And if you're a fan of fighting games looking for a new online scene to smash to bits, stay far, far, far away from this game.

10/10 visuals
6/10 gameplay

And yes, i am very bad at this game. I'm not trying to hide it. But i've been playing fighting games ever since i picked up tekken 2 at 5 years old. I spent around 8 of my 25 hours played in this game in practice mode, perfecting assist combos and finding news ways to extend them, but in its current state (and with the current online scene in this game being the way that it is) i can't recommend this game to someone looking for a good and well balanced fighting game

Edit: after spending more time with the game I have to add on a couple more negatives
-2 DRMs
-lobby system necessary for any kind of play
-characters lack uniqueness, combos are practically universal
-most normals are safe on block
-8 hours of story to unlock 21, unless you preordered
-story mode is repetitive and burns you out fast
-if you want to unlock SS blue goku and Vegeta you have to take on insane difficulty cpus with constantly regenerating meter and higher damage scaling, or pay 3$
-season pass
-rage quitting is abundant and goes unpunished
-lack of friends list system
-lack of lobby communication, with only preset messages and stamps

[td]By far one of the best out of all, second to Budoukai Tenkaichi 3. However, The game is great in it's own way as it kind of introduces a fresh air around it. I was starting to get bored of Xenoverse 1 and 2 as it revisits the history for DBZ and I just didn't like how Xenoverse 2 was technically a copy of Xenoverse 1 but better in some sort of way. I love the new story for DragonBall FighterZ and I do hope it everyone enjoys it too.[/td]",1518531352,1518624816,TRUE,1,0,0.501519799,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,421,48,991,0,764,1521989838

40057593,english,"FIrst off,

Would i reccomend this game as a whole...Heck Yeah!! Are there things in the game that seem unpolished....absolutely. What it really comes down to is the replay value for me.

Im no professional at fighting games, absolutely not my strong suit but being a fan of fighting games has always made me want to pick up a stick or pad and try my best at it. This game is one of the best fighting games for beginner players. If you think your interested in fighting games and want to give them a try start with this first. Mechanics are easy to learn in the tutorials that new players can pick it up really quickly. But just because you finish tutorial doesnt mean yull be an expert. As with all fighting games it takes a tad bit pf practice to master your craft.

Thats one of the flaws with this game. To go more indepth with the mechanics you have to search online forums or videos to learn the diffent tech for characters or actual mechanics.( For example the sparking blast mechanics) Theres not an advanced tutorial that some other Arc Sys games have. Also the combo challenges are 90% the same for all the character.

Another flaw in the game is story mode. Im not going to sugar coat it at all. ITS BORING!!! In the beginning Arc you actually play training dummys. It would be a bit more bearable if they had auto feature for the cutscenes instead of me clicking the A button to continuiously advance in the story.

Lets get to the good stuff!!

While the online servers have their issues on occasion. Multiplayer is where this game shines, besides a few instances where i get completely blown out. ive never had a game where i didnt want to rematch someone to see if i could beat them more. Let me explain....There are times where i lose such close matches i instanly hit that rematch button without a second thought. The mechanics along with the character knowledge i learn in this game makes me actually want to learn from my mistake and play better. I can still lose but i dont lose as bad as i did the first game of the set.... like Hit ""im constantly improving""

This game is just awesome. One of the best fighting games I've played. 
It is a lot of fun and all the hype about this game is more than justified.
I Strongly recommend it.

Pros:
- Visually stunning. The characters look exactly(or even better) like they look in the anime. The animations are fluid and gorgeous. The scenarios are simple but they fit the game as it focus on the characters. 
- The Dragon Ball universe is weel represented here. Not only do the characters look exactly like they should but every single movement, pose, animation and attack comes straight from the manga or anime. The voice actors(English or Japanese) are the same as the anime. The respect that the team showed for the source material is unparalled. This isn't just a Dragon Ball adaptation. This is as Dragon Ball as it gets.
- The game mechanics are easy to learn but complex and difficult to master. It can be enjoyed by newcomers as well as fighting game experts. It is very rewarding see yourself grow as a player and become better at the game.
- The characters are well balanced and very unique. The main characters in Dragon Ball are playable and there are more on the way. 
- The game has many game options including arcade, story, practice, combo practice, local play and of course online multiplayer.
- The netcode is good. Playing online is fluid. The game allows you to choose the connection level, which lets you avoid bad connections.
- The story itself is good and it feels like you're watching the anime. The main villain is interesting and the character interactions are funny and natural.

Cons
- The main menu being a lobby is cute but it doesn't really work for me. To play the game you need to move your avatar in a map and I would've preferred a tradicional main menu.
- The Story mode gameplay is repetitive. In between cutscenes you fight with a never ending stream of CPU clones and it gets a little boring. It is worth it to get 21.

Positives

+ No loot boxes

-----
Negatives
-----
- Story mode is super boring, and you need to do all of it to unlock a certain character.
- Matchmaking is kind of inaccurate, even in casual mode. A lot of the time you'll just get wrecked by someone the same threat level as you and it gets demoralizing.

+Game just feels nice to play and the characters are fun and hold true to how the generally fight in the anime/manga.

-As of right now the matchmaking system is pretty bad but with how much hype and how well it is still doing that should be fixed soon hopefully.

-34 dollar season pass....

-3 base characters locked behind mildly annoying content 21 behind story mode and ssgss vegeta and goku behind the hard versions of the arcade mode which unlocking goku and vegeta can be a problem for really new players as you need an s ranking on two different maps to unlock them both

The balance is dumb, you have heavy slow characters that have the same health but deal less damage than the fast characters.

You have auto combos that deal 50% health so people have to put virtually no effort or thought into what they're doing.

Assists recall if your character is hit making them 100% worthless outside of combo extensions.

There is no combo variety that doesn't involve assists. If you don't have an assist available be ready to literally do the same exact combo off of the same exact hit confirm every single time.

The lobby system is absolutely retarded. You can't queue for an online match from the main menu, every time you enter a menu your match search is paused.

Super Dash is a busted mechanic that tracks, is safe on block and leads to a full combo on hit.

It's not hard to beat but makes the game incredibly unfun to play against virtually everyone that does super dash all the time. The risk/reward for super dash is non existent.

39920255,english,"I gave the thumb up for this game and I will explain it later,but first, let me explain why this game is actually bad:
1) This game is NOT competitive(blasphemy mode activated). I've seen guys who say that chars are balanced... they are not; most of them have a peculiar way to fight that differs from char to char, someone has got the Z assist such as N°18, others have got the guardbreak, such as Goku Black. Still believe the contrary? Please go online and check how many Nappa,Ginew and Krillin you see. 

2)According to the first point, this game isn't fair.  To have a real fair play, 2 players should match with the the same characters and the same non-autofired joypad... that would be a competition, otherwise it is just ""fun"" (yea, games used to be fun once). You can't even stop the combo by using ki.

3) Original Story mode? Pfff... 
Okay, Android 21 is interesting, but that soul connection is totally lame.

4) Small roster... it feels like to play a Nintendo DS game.

5) 2.5D is so limitating for this brand. I mean, I can even fly in Ultimate Battle 22, and that was a PS1 game!

6)It's an online based game, because Arcade has got just 3 sub-arcades and their hard mode respectively, and story mode isn't that much. Should online games cost less than games who have got single and multiplayer?

7) Hard to socialize: unlike XV2, FZ hasn't got the co-op mode, no one is using the social tab even.

---

So you might think that this isn't the right game for you... still it is DBZ.
This game can be a pain in the ass for casual gamers, but it's Dragon Ball. That anime you used to watch on TV when you were a kid, now it returns on your monitor. I must admit that firing a Kamehameha on DBFZ is so damn satisfying; the cool thing is that it's not only about fighting over and over, you can see even how Z warriors and villains act to each other. And especially after all that story mode's mess, Goku will break the fourth wall and he will say ""You're the best!"", that's the true Dragon Ball's spirit. There's even a fourth wall breaking in game you can achieve by not breaking it, and an easter egg which is not a easter egg, but I will leave the rest for you ;) 
If I should give it a vote, it would be 7/10 lol
Enjoy this game.

39919368,english,"Ok so here's the thing. I'm a both fan. As in I love DBZ as well as fighting games in general (my library). This game, is sooo hype. My favorite fighter besides maybe Smash, is Blazblue, a highly technical anime fighter. The disadvantage of BB is that it's tough to git gud. And can be really unforgiving against anyone who remotely knows what they're doing. DBFZ is NOT that game. If you have ANY experience with anime fighters at all messing around in the training room will mostly prepare you. Tutorial is good just incase you missed something. Combos are easy to execute. Frame windows are very forgiving with loose timing. Auto combos, while present, are not everything and far from optimal. The offensive and defensive options are very cut and dry almost to the point of rock paper scissors. But here's what's the most important. While it is certainly easy to get a handle on, it is still fun for people who appreciate other harder fighters. It's vibrant, it's cinematic, it's colorful, it's everything a Dragonball game should be. If you've never played a hardcore fighter before, start here. Especially if you're a fan of DBZ. This game is the perfect opportunity to get your feet wet. Yeah, the online is still being worked on. It's not a perfect lobby system. There are cons. It's not a 10/10.

With optimized graphics to easy to use controls to the competitve play style sold me from the moment I heard of this game. The animated cutscenes and gameplay make you feel like you are right in the anime.

There are the usual rage quitters that found there way from the xenoverse series so expect the loss of connection during or after a match.

39911098,english,"I actually like this game a lot. But have just 2 complains.

1- The Story is great, but the filler part were you have to fight hordes of ""random generic characters"" (Dont want to spoil) is just too long if you want to 100% complete every map.

2- There are not that many characters, they feel good but I think more (free ones) would be a welcome addition. The FighterZ pass including 8 more I think will be worth it (if the leaks are true)

Now some of the good things are: (There are more, but I dont have the time to think about all of them right now)

1- Android 21 is a really cool character. Once you play through all 3 Arcs you really get to like her. It is well though, has a good design and story.

2-Interactions in this game are awesome. You get some major ones in the story (I feel sorry for yamcha most the time) and then you get some when you mix and match characters during normal battles on the winning screen. As an example, if you play as Vegeta and Kakarot in the same team and win as Vegeta, he will proceed to say that he didnt need his help to win wich is right on Vegeta´s character and much more.

3-You get a lot of gamemodes and ""splitscreen"" versus. I played a lot of Story and local versus, as well as the arcade mode.
Then you get Casual, Ranked and Arena matches wich I didnt play a lot but bring some refreshing variety to the game.

4- The graphics and animations are really well made, even the parallax effect on each map feels spot on.

5- No character (At the moment of writing) feels OP to me. You have 1 ultimate you can do with Android 16 that includes blowing up as he did in the cell saga that just kills the oponent if he gets to grab him and leaves him with 1 hp. This is a cool and dificult to do move, but I think 16 being able to regain health after this (if not killed in 1 hit before changing him) is not ok, he should stay at 1 hp. (He cant use this ability again)

Overall I would give this game a solid 8/10 that could climb to a 9/10 if they gave at least 2 more free characters.
Every character is well made and has some uniqueness, but I still feel they felt just a little bit short.

I would be so happy if they made him and added his death scene as a special cut-scene (If you kill him with special beam cannon and have Goku on your team, Goku grabs him and piccolo kills them both).

The right amount of craziness on screen without it being cheap. Example: Marvel vs Capcom will leave your ""minions"" you call on screen even if you die or change out. DBFZ will kill yours instead.

39897892,english,"Disclaimer (moved here the interesting part):
For those who have never played a 2D fighting game it'll be hard to go online and enjoy the game without understanding all the mechanics and spending time practicing combos, movement and general basic strategies ( blocking, how to counter spamming, SD, etc.etc.). 
It's not rocket science, and in the end, there's enough information out there to understand how to deal with pretty much any scrub and mindless tactics that there is. 
Once players are able to recognize and punish those weak strategies the real game begins. 

The visuals are gorgeous, and many animations and poses are the exact recreation of the original anime/manga.

The gameplay is smooth, polished and fun. It can be a mash-fest with friends and newcomers to fighting game or a highly technical and deep battle of reads, skill and knowledge between experts. 

Sound and BGM work well, Voiceovers are good however there are no OST or classic DB soundtracks. 

The roster is small compared to most DB games ( average if compared to 2D fighters) but every character plays with a unique style and more will be available as DLC

Story mode and Arcade won't last longer than 10-15 hrs, so you'd better play it for the multiplayer content.

39884377,english,"As a person that usually avoids fighting games like the plaque (unless it's something like Smash Brothers), the fact that this game not only grabbed my attention (if only because I'm a Dragon Ball fan), but kept me coming back to it and getting slowly better, just shows how accessible this is to even fighting game newbies.

That said, it's most likely the fact that I am a Dragon Ball fan that keeps me coming back. If you're not that big on Dragon Ball in any way (particularly Z and Super, which this game draws a lot of its material from), you're likely not going to be able to stay invested and appreciate how well this game represents the series and its characters. 

If you are a fan, however, then I can say with confidence that this game will satisfy on visual appeal alone. The fact that Arc System was able to almost perfectly translate the 2D style of the show into 3D is a sight to behold, and I hope that future DBZ games, Arc System or otherwise, keeps up this art style, because it would be a waste of potential for this engine to be unused after 1 game.

I can't really give the fighting system a true, in-depth look, as I haven't even come close to understanding it. However, as I said before, I've never played an arcade fighter of this style until now, and the fact that a total newbie like myself can jump in, and enjoy the game as much as I do, shows how accessible it is, so if you are at all wanting to jump into the fighting genre, I think this is a good starting point.

If I could name two negatives about the game, it's the lack of replay saving and the current methods of playing online with friends. DBFZ allows you to save your matches as ""replays"" and watch them back in the hub area. I say ""replays"" when they are really just saves of the inputs from both players that gets looped back. The problem I have is that there's no option to save it as a video file. I can understand this for the console versions of the game, but it feels like a missed oppurtunity to not have it on PC. Yes, you can just record them using any screen-recording software you have, but that's a tedious process if you have multiple replays you want to save. I'm not asking for anything complex; a simple, one-button method of saving replays as video files would be greatly appreciated.

As for my second problem, playing with friends online is quite a crab-shoot. With local play, all you need is two control methods and two players, and its as easy as going to the ""local play"" hub and adjusting some things. With online, you have to be in the same lobby as each other and hope that the lobby doesn't boot you out after a match. Granted, the latter part didn't happen often when me and a friend of mine played, but it was still annoying to finish a match only to get booted back to the home screen because we disconnected from the lobby for a split second.

39883247,english,"**I returned the game** Now before anything else, it was returned because my controller died on me and I decided to get the game on my PS4 instead of buying a new controller. I did not like using the keyboard.

THAT being said, this game (played just under an hour) is flipping fantastic. Now I am not a fighting game fan (this style at least), and Injustice 1 and 2 I got because DCU, and this one is DBZ!!!!!! My first Anime show and favorite. That's not why it's good though.

*PRO'S*
EAsy to learn
Good tutorial for beginners
Amazing animations (I believe they went through the show frame by frame to get the moves and fighting styles as perfect as possible).
Smooth and well optimized in every way.
Near seamless keyboard defaults
CAN MAP YOUR KEYBOARD BUTTONS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE XBOX CONTROLLER BUTTONS DISPLAYED NEXT TO THEM!!
Has the competitive side with advanced moves and tactics for weathered players.
Every character is unique, from visuals to move sets, to the animations of each fighter as they fight. Krillin's Kamehameha (The quick version) is small, lower damage and quicker than Goku's same Kamehameha version. Yamcha for the first time ever is VALID, and honestly is the best character. His Wolf Fang style is beautiful. 

*Cons*
Using the keyboard is annoying
Some sound issues with the speakers crackling and ""shooting"" crackling sounds as you run through cut scenes. (This may not happen to everyone, but it is there.)
Character roster, while amazing to it's own extent, lacks characters, but 8 more are coming soon!!!! (By lacks I mean that even though there are a lot of different characters, I'm excited for apparently Broly, Bardock, Janemba, Kefla, Jiren, Toppo, and two others.) 

ALL in ALL, 9.7/10 overall!!!!! Whether you get it on Steam, XBox, or PS... it is 100% worth the price tag.

39876503,english,"TL;DR at the end

Ok, let's tackle this game shall we? This game, is freaking good, and I mean it when I say it's good. You can see there is a lot of passion put into this game, and true knowledge of the Dragon Ball universe, full voice acting of various languages, a story mode, arcade mode, overworld that you can do alot of stuff, online gameplay, combo challenges, great gameplay with outstanding graphics and so it goes, BUT it has it's weaknesses. 

First things first story mode, I'm glad it's here, and it took me around 15 hours to beat, BUT, you'll be fighting a bunch of potatoes, there is not a single challenging fight in the whole story mode, and it gets repetitive really fast, so those 15 hours might hurt. The amazing thing about the story are the character interactions, setting up different parties to see how they talk to each other in some very funny to watch cutscenes  with full voice acting to each character. The story itself is just an excuse to gather the cast and make they punch things, it's meh, but it works. You'll unlock Android 21 after you finish all the segments in the story mode.

Arcade mode, present in 3 different ""courses"" that have a normal and hard mode, you can unlock Goku and Vegeta SSGSS in the arcade, if you beat two courses being able to score at least an A rank at the end, it's fun single player memes to enjoy, and i'm glad there is a way to unlock the characters without the purchase.

The overworld, this is a pretty cute feature, you'll walk around and talk to NPCs that can take you to each activity in the game, there are also other players that you can interact with and create rooms to fight with a bunch of people, and that removes the wait of the matchmaker. You earn Zeni in the game, and gaining 300k and 500k zeni will also unlock you vegeta SSGSS and Goku SSGSS respectively, again, very nice. Zeni can be used to purchase capsules that contain avatar skins, colour for characters, announcers for the fights, a bunch of cool stuff to unlock. 

To the online now, it's important to note that I'm playing in the South America server, so I'm not the best example of game population, but the matchmaker can take some time to find matches. It's nice that you can select the desired connection you want to play with and skill level so the match will be smooth and balanced. Now how does ranked work? You'll fight other players in a best of 3 match, and after the match ends you'll get points,  as you gain more points, you'll rise in rank, if you lose points, you lose rank.

And last but not least, the combat, the gameplay, so how is it? It's nice, yet chaotic, and very unforgiving, if you are a fighting game fan you'll most likely enjoy the game, and it's Marvel vs Capcom esque style, with teams of 3 that can tag in and out and call for support attacks. The auto combo system allows for a new player to get into the game faster, but a good player will stray from this and learn a bunch of combos and synergy between characters, and here might be the pickle of the situation. Like I said, chaotic, and unforgiving, it feels great to deliver a massive combo and chain supers from all your team, the problem in my eyes is that you can sometimes delete an enemy character with a good combo, or nearly kill it, if your enemy mess up, you'll juggle him like a sack of potatoes left to right for several seconds without much the enemy can do to escape this punishment, and the same works for you, i've seen combos that simply delete one of my team members before I can even say shit. So if this hypes you to get online and destroy people getting the cinematic endings, those are really cool btw, this game is for you. But if you just want to play this because you're a dragon ball fan and you don't really have interest in going online, I would probably wait for a price drop, when the full deluxe xxx edition comes out with all characters from DLC and stuff, because this game doesn't have enough single player content to sustain it's full price, xenoverse 2 has the better single player dragon ball fun, but not the more serious combat system that FighterZ has, if you're paying the whole thing for this game, you should play the online.

So for the TL;DR
If you're a fan of fighting games, go right for it, it's a great and fun game.
If you're just a dragon ball fan wanting to play around for a bit, I would wait for a price drop. But if you're too hungry for the action, this a great game.",1517871906,1517872499,TRUE,77,2,0.843557,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,272,13,8247,0,2157,1590045453

The fighting system is easy to learn, if you have played any Marvel VS Capcom games, then your likely good to go as far as Dragon Ball fighterZ is concerned. It's simple enough a new player can get involved and really enjoy the combat, but complex enough the advanced players will be analizing frame by frame for months to come.

The graphics even though 2.5D are perfect. It's right in line with the anime and I have not seen anything come this close before now, with the exception of Dragon Ball Z Tudokai Tienkaichi 3.

The characters are unique and represent the span of the series really well, the general playstyle is easy to pick up but each character has a unique twist that makes them different to play, and it's generally really satisfying.

I see literally two problems with the game.

1. The AI is a bit bad. They don't fall for things like humans do, and fall for weird stuff like raw level 3 supers... constantly. That's not to say people won't fall for that, but you kind of have to bait them into it. Buy them dinner first.

2. Like the show, it's not entirely balanced. I can do much more with Kid Buu or Goku Black than I could if I spend as long with say... Vegeta or Kid Gohan. It's not the end of the world, but you can expect a lot of Hit, Goku Black, and Kid Buu online.

Aside from that, it's seriously not just a solid Dragon Ball game, but a legitimately solid fighting game, with it's own systems to keep it unique and different.

39856817,english,"This is the most accessible fighting game I've played in recent years.  Everything in the game builds off of something basic and modifies or combines it in some amazing way. The game has a big emphasis on the neutral game, where players get that first hit in. Then, once that first hit connects, new players can auto-combo it into reasonable damage, good players can combo it into good damage, and great players can do even more. The biggest praise I can put on it is that it's still a fun game to lose. Even when I was most outclassed, I thought to myself ""Argh! If I'd only done X"" or ""If I had done Y instead of mashing out X"".

My only complaint is the translation. They've taken some liberties with the dialogue, espeically in story mode. Any time that the characters say something particularly snarky to eachother, it's probably been altered from the original line.

For example, in story mode, Yamcha might pray to god in hopes that their enemies will be weak.

39853617,english,"To be honest, I don't know if I really recommend this game, I have a neutral feeling about it.

The Story : You don't buy this game for the story. It's not even worth 10$, and we play the story 3 times through different ""factions"", The good people, the bad people and the androids. I won't spoil it but it took like 12 hours to do the 3 factions and I honestly think this faction thing is because the original story was 4 hours and they wanted it to be longer artificially, which is really sad. They also tried to do a scientific explanation about why is Cell as strong as Goku SSB, etc. which I found weird but I think is to avoid fans to cry over Bandai Namco. 5/10

Gameplay : This is the interesting part. I love the gameplay and I think is the main reason why you should get that game, it's so satisfying to do a kamehameha with Goku. The only thing is the ""easy combos"" when you spam x or y to do a combo, but these are not the most powerful combos in the game. To get better you need to actually practice, and that is nice. I also think that the DBS Character are stronger than the rest of the cast, but that's just my opinion.

Roster : The roster is correct, but there are a lot of character missing. Where's Muten-Roshi? Goku as a kid? Broly? Chichi? Oolong? Mr. Popo? Lunch? Jackie Chun?

DLC : I bought the FighterZ Pass, but I don't recommend it until you see the DLC Characters, Namco is greedy and until we see what we pay for, just keep your money.

Overall, buy this game only if you're a fan of Dragon Ball. The story is bad but the gameplay is good and the fights really look like in the anime.



TL;DR : Don't buy the game until we get Mr. Popo",1517780104,1517780104,TRUE,3,0,0.56349206,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,772,16,9961,133,2424,1601009980

DBFZ is one hell of a 3v3 fighter that's been designed from the ground up to be extremely accessible yet retains a lot of depth from both Capcom's VS series and ArcSys' traditional anime airdashers (Guilty Gear and BlazBlue). Graphics are brilliant as expected from this studio and the attention to detail in this game will surely satisfy even the most casual DB fans. It's a damn good final product and the DLC will only make it better from here on out.

Also worth nothing, this is by far the highest selling fighting game of all time on PC, beating out Tekken 7 by almost 3:1.

(Disclaimer: I've never watched DB or DBZ in my life nor will I ever care to)

+Optimization is stellar (this game will run on anything, I promise).
+Uses a slightly modified control scheme from UMVC3.
+Most traditional fighting game character archetypes are all represented in the base roster.
+Soundtrack is godlike.
+Android 21 is a high tier waifu.
+Seems to use Guilty Gear Rev2's netcode which is without a doubt the best delay-based netcode on the market currently.

+-Lobby system was absolutely busted for a few days after release but seems to have cleared up recently. Still, the lobby system is a mess and it's way too hard to simply play a set with a friend, especially considering Guilty Gear Rev2's lobbies fully support Steamworks invites. Bamco, plz.
+-Android 21, SSGSS Goku and SSGSS Vegeta are locked behind story mode completion and S ranks on arcade mode, respectively. Could be difficult for super casuals to unlock.
+-Voice acting is very hit or miss.

-The neutral in this game is more fucked up than Marvel 3, although I'm not sure this is something that can be easily fixed.
-Some assists are laughably terrible, and considering each character only has 1 assist this could be problematic down the line.
-Uses EasyAntiCheat for literally no reason at all whatsoever. Cheating in fighting games on PC has never been an issue.
-Expensive season pass/DLC.

TL;DR it's pretty much what we all wanted MvC4 to be. Thank you, based ArcSys.

- THIS is the go-to game for fighter game beginners. It's fairly easy to get into, even for scrublords like me.

- Story mode is a hit or miss for people, personally IMO this story mode is on par if not better than Xenoverse's. It does get repetitive, even for me. There are 3 acts, First one is a pushover, second one is fairly challenging and the third one can whoop your ass if you handicap yourself by not using passives like me (I started using health regen passives after one GAME OVER). You can make storymode faster by just heading straight for the boss of the area but you'll miss out on finding new passives and potentially being underleveled and etc.

Update 1 - The arcade mode is rough, the enemies are made artificially tougher if you do very well (attack, defense, Ki bar regens faster). I'll just assume that this is made to compensate for the lack of brain from the AI, although a single combo can end you on higher difficulties regardless.

lobby sytem is really bad, why cant i just invite my friend and play,  why do we both need to join the same lobby and do so many extra steps. much more bullshit like ring matches (the only way as of now to play with your friend), if you wanna switch character you have to exit the whole thing choose a character (no random button) and then join it again. Why??.

ATLEAST i can join a lobby and play an online match but it can take a awhile to find one like 2-3 minutes and i dont think its the player count thats the problem, for a fighting game on steam there is a huge huge player count.

They did so many things right with this game like the practice mode and the fighting mechanics and characters but the hiccups are a huge pain in the ass.
Still this game is crazy fun and i love this game playing as dragon ball z characters is fucking amazing.
This game was a hit or miss for me and it was a huge hit.

One of the better fighting games on steam and i think $60 dollars might have scared people away but if you like DBZ or fighting games or want to play a cool fighting game check this game out. 4 otta 5.",1517724212,1517724374,TRUE,1,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,138,5,5564,0,863,1597633357

This game is for sure noob friendly, the lobby system isn't all that bad, it just takes some time to get used to, but it's a good idea to have for the sake of you can battle almost anyone anytime since this game isn't dead. The only problem I have is the story, for me it just seems to drag on especially once you hit the later chapters. Saying that doesn't mean story mode isn't bad all together, it just drags on for me personally, it does however help you learn simple combos and other mechanics that other fighting games don't teach you. 

This game is fantastic and by far one of the best fighting games I have played in a long time.

I did state that this game revolutionized the fighting game genre, why? Well first, since the game first shipped it sold 2 million copies+ and counting. Lastly, the game is well received by the crowd and a lot of beginners in the fighting game genre are enjoying the experience DBFz has to offer. 

The visuals in the game, despite its anime feel, are absolutely majestic. The game plays exceptionally smooth and everything flows very well. The game also has a feel of ""Power"" to it since you pretty much have all your abilities in disposal almost all the time making the game more fun to play. And please, you can play three of your favorite characters at a time! Talk about absolute chaos in the field of battle!

- The fighting speed is much faster than any of the previous Dragonball titles, making it much more exciting to play.

- The graphics reconcile the animated nature of the universe and new generation quality of detail.

- The UI and the general feel of the universe remained very DBZ-esque. The story mode is reminiscent of DBZ Budokai 2's system, albeit not operating in the same fashion. It was much richer and more developed in Budokai 2.


[b][u]Negative[/u][/b]

- The character number is extremely limited compared to previous titles. It feels empty. Where are the Cell forms, Frieza forms, Android 17, Android 20, kid Gohan, Dabura, base Goku/Vegeta/Trunks/Gotenks, Super Buu, Hercule, Raditz, Recoome, Supreme Kai, Whis, Cooler, Bardock, Broly, Uub, Gogeta, etc.?

- Apparently the upcoming characters will be locked behind a DLC(s). For a game that already costs $60 USD, that would be pathetic.

- You can't transform during the game (ex: taking base Goku and ending up as SS3 at the end of the fight).

- Online play needs to be refined with the whole server limitations, connection issues, searching time and so forth.

- The game's content doesn't justify a $60 USD price tag, especially when important paid DLCs will probably come.

Great and fast-paced fighting. Feels nostalgic. Harmonizes animated theme with modern generation visuals.

Standard modes such as Arcade Mode and Versus play work well here, giving the players a lot of options in terms of battling with others. The fighting system allows for 3v3 battles, with the player able to tag between them to allow the injured fighters to recover health.

Not to say other Dragon Ball games are bad, but the amount of detail and passion that ASW has put into this game is just astounding.  Look up IKevinX's manga reference series and you'll see what I'm talking about.  

As for the gameplay:  If you've ever wanted to get into fighting games, this is the perfect entry point.  As much as I couldn't stand the auto-combo system at first, it's taught me to be a better player.  Now that anyone can do a basic combo into specials and super moves, I have train myself not to be put into situations where someone can just mash buttons and beat me.  While the auto-combos are present, there's still rewards for doing your traditional manual combos (damage, meter, positioning, hard knockdowns, etc.).   I know something that probably bugged people about assists in the Marvel vs. Capcom series was how frequently you could call them.  Assists like Dr. Doom's Hidden Missiles, you'd just call because it covered you dashing in.  What ASW did for this game was made assist cooldowns longer, and in addition, that cooldown doesn't start until your combo has ended.  There are just as many fine tuned details in the game mechanics as there are with the games aesthetics.  

Oh yeah, there's a story mode too.  And it's awesome.  One reason I quit playing Dragon Ball games was because how often they just had you playthrough the same scenarios we've seen since 1997 (also, there was no online multiplayer back in the day).  So this game's story is a total what-if scenario and Toriyama created a new character (Android 21) just for it.  

I only have two real complaints for the game's online service (which will get sorted out in time):

1.) Because there are so many people playing and it's on ASW/Bamco's servers, I tend to get kicked off randomly during peak hours.

But not here, the simpllified mode systems, unique charecters, and hi speed action, means even newbies and beginners can get in and feel good. Once you get in, and get comfortable, you start to find the tricks and combos to the game all on your own, and it has great tutorials, good combo trainers, a fun, if a bit to padded story mode, and great variety of online optoins.

net codes a bit chokny, but for hte most part, Im having to much fun and cant stop playing.

If your a fighting fan or a DBZ fan, this game is a PERFERCT fit. 

IF you love games that looks good, they dont get much better.

39637122,english,"I previously wrote a review for this game, but my views on it have changed slightly and I have a better grasp on everything this game has to offer. For this review, I'll be breaking down my likes and dislikes for both the single player modes and the multiplayer. I'll also have a section on graphics, sounds, voices, animation, etc.

First: The multiplayer.

I'm gonna start with the multiplayer, for the simple reason that it's the main selling point of fighting games. A majority of people will buy it in order to test their mettle in the ruthless online. So, first off, the netcode in this game is pretty great. When finding casual matches, you can set the level of ping you wish to find, so if you only want at least decent connections and no bad ones, that option is available to you. The delay is constantly displayed next to the timer, so it's easy to know when things are getting a little shotty. And that's nice, since you can try to lay off being aggressive until it calms back down when someone gets whacked with a lag spike (it happens no matter how good your netcode is).

The things I don't like are the lobby system, and the weird ways that finding matches works in this game. You have options, you can find a casual match, an arena match, or a ring match. I've sat in casual match ques for up to 10 minutes (Longer than that is really not worth it in my honest opinion.) and found no one. So, I generally cross that off. Arena matches are where you randomly get paired up to fight other random people who enter this arena. One match, then it's back to waiting. This system seems to be broken, in the fact that I'll see 4-5 other people waiting to find a match (it shows them on the outside of the arena) but still wait 2+ minutes. Sometimes, I'll deny the person with a bad connection, just to wait 2 mins, and get him again without getting the option to fight the other 4 people waiting. It doesn't seem to make much sense. In the arena, there's also no option for a rematch, so you just have to hope you get lucky if you wanted to play that person again. Lastly with the arena, it seems to not pair 2 people with each other unless there is 3 or more waiting. If two people are waiting for a match, you have to wait for a third person to enter the arena in order to fight each other, which doesn't make much sense. I tend to use it anyways, but these things do annoy me. The last one is Ring matches, where you essentially make a room that sits in the middle of the lobby and people can join. There, you can rotate people in and out. Now, in this mode there's essentially two fights that can go on, and people basically line up to try to take on the winner. For some reason, this mode has the option for a rematch. So, you don't HAVE to give the person in line a turn. You can just rematch and keep them waiting (this has happened to me, and I end up just leaving due to impatience). It doesn't make sense to me that the version where people line up to fight has rematches, but the one where people are randomly paired together (No one is really waiting for a turn, they could fight one of the other people in the arena at the same time) has no rematch. If two people in the arena play a set together, no one is forced to wait longer. It doesn't make much sense to me personally.

Next: The singleplayer.
Again, I'll start with the positives. The story is interesting. Without spoiling much, you are essentially the main character in this anime. And it's fun, creative, and original. There's lots of in-jokes, and it's enjoyable when you get to cutscenes. The arcade mode is interesting. If you pre-ordered there isn't much reason to play it, but it has branching difficulties and if you wanna get some practice in before jumping into online this could be a good place to go against some hardcore computers to try to ready yourself. The combo challenges are very simple, and even a garbage player like myself can manage to complete most of them, but they do teach you the basics of comboing with different characters and how to begin incorporating their gimmicks into your combos.

Onto the negatives of the single player, the number one part is being forced to jump into an online lobby. Me personally, I find it annoying that everything is a weird lobby with the chibi characters. I feel like this should have been solely for the multiplayer, and not the entire menu for the game. Sometimes, I just want to jump in, click story on the menu, and go back to where I left off. Going through a lobby, teleporting to the story man, and talking to him to pick my arc is all steps I shouldn't have to take. Let's not mention the ever annoying fact that New Game is always the first selection, and you have to press down to get to Continue on the story. So many times have I hit A too many times just to wind up in a cutscene for a new story. Why did it have to be like that? Putting continue on top after you save in the story is very basic, and I feel it was overlooked. With the story mode GAMEPLAY itself, I hate it. I find it tedious, annoying, grindy, and basically what I call ""Artificial time wasting"". Instead of jumping scene to scene and fight to fight, between every cutscene you have a new board and have to play a board game. You encounter different fights to level up your characters JRPG style. It's very annoying, since most of the time you can't avoid fighting 2-3 fights before the boss fight to get to the next part of the story. On top of that, your characters only heal a set amount after every fight. So sometimes you can wind up going into a boss fight with all of your characters at half health. I haven't lost yet, but the game is starting to pick up difficulty (I'm near the end of the second arc) and getting very punishing (compared to the first arc, which was basically pound the punching bags over and over). At first it seemed like an interesting idea, but it's really just a way to make the story mode much much longer without actually putting more content into the game. I don't like it, maybe someone else does, but I don't. I find it tedious and annoying, but I have to play it to unlock Android 21. 

Last things:

Sound - No real complaints. The music doesn't stand out, but it isn't annoying either. The hits and effects in the fights are amazing, and the punches and explosions sound just like the TV show.

Graphics: Beautiful graphics, no complains. Cell shading is very nice, and all of the moves and characters are bright and colorful and filled with explosive particles.

Voices: I use just the japanese voices, since I don't really like the dubbed voices. But the japanese ones sound great, and you can tell the voice actors put a decent amount of effort into it.

Animation: The animations in the fights are amazing, and each character has a ton of personality. The story mode cutscene animations seem to jump back and forth. One scene will look incredible, while another one will look clunky and awkward. The cutscenes overall are hit or miss for me.

Summary: The game has it's issues. Most of these are easy to overlook, since they're more nitpicky and the gameplay itself is pretty great. The fighting, the mechanics, and the combos are all fun and accessible. The story is hit or miss, for me it's a miss but I'll begrudgingly get through it eventually. I still recommend this game, but hope that these criticisms get some notice and maybe one day will be fixed.",1516998653,1517637150,TRUE,1,0,0.495523542,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,96,13,1707,0,1084,1535505867

-The story mode is pretty meh. There are some cool ideas with the style, and the cutscenes are well done. Overall, though, it just felt lacking. Android 21 is a neat addition, though. That's really my only gripe. 

+Fantastic optimization, runs well even on my laptop (I5, 940mx video card) and even better on my desktop (I7, 1080ti).
+Online play has been generally smooth, though I have only spent a few hours on it. I play on a wired connection.
+Characters are a blast. I have never had so much trouble sticking with a team, and it's because all of the cast is fun to play.
+No (cash) loot boxes.
+Fun little customization options, the lobby is a nice touch.
+Great for fighting game newcomers. Always loved fighting games but ended up dropping most due to the high barrier to entry. Fighterz is a good middle ground of ""easy to pick up, hard to master"".

Yet it also has some nice added features like a warp to the current objective option that make navigation the social space simple for players that just want to push through to the action.

Story so for is awesome and im really enjoying the fresh new story  instead of it being like all the old games where it follows the anime but with Dragon Ball Super added. Everyone is attracted to the new character Akira Toriyama created, which is humorous but i can see why. But the interactions so far between the characters seem cool, and has a ""breaking the 4th wall"" feel to it. 

Sound is on point. Those classic sound effects from the anime along with one hell of a bad ass soundtrack. Voices are Dubbed in both Japanese and English, however you have to change it to English from Japanese when you first boot it up.

39782229,english,"Dragonball FighterZ is a brilliant way into the fighter game genre. With gorgeous visuals, iconic characters, and clean game-play; this game is worth all the praise it's loving community is pouring over it.

The story mode has the characters in a new scenario, introducing a new 'baddie' named ""Android 21"". While her personality is a little cliche ticking all the boxes of the evil anime girl trope, she oddly fits nicely into the Dragonball universe. It takes completing the story mode however to fully appreciate the effort put into her character, and the story they've given her. The rest of the cast is full of familiar faces from the show, and they deliver lines that are incredibly faithful to the show. Watching cutscenes, I laughed at how well the lines fit the character who spoke them. The story mode contains a few 'plastered-on' gameplay mechanics that seem out of place, like a turn-based story-pathing system. I never even got near to reaching the turn limit, which made me wonder what it's purpose was. Overall the story mode was a great experience; great practice for people new to the fighting game genre, and a story akin to watching a new Dragonball movie.

The game also contains a lobby mode to play with friends locally. An arcade mode to challenge and reward players outside multiplayer and the story. A practice mode, complete with a combo trainer. The ability to challenge people within your lobby (or hub zone) to a duel, or engage with multiple people within an arena. A shop to use hard-earned in-game currency to aquire a long list of collectables. Finally a way to challenge people region-wide to a duel for either a casual match or a ranked match. With the ranked matches is included a ranked ladder to view the best of the best, and watch replays of their fights.

Arc System Works are no strangers to the fighting game genre, and as such have done an amazing job at bringing Dragonball to the fighting scene. The combat is fluid, the hit-boxes are clean, and the camera angles paired with the vibrant colours make this a game that is hard to grow tired of. While easy for people to pick up, there is no loss to how strategically complex the game can be. A Youtube search for ""Dragonball Fighterz Combos"" will show you that the mastery curve can get incredibly steep.

With all reviews however, you must spend time to look into the negatives. The lobby system currently in use has recieved some backlash, as people can be kicked out randomly, and some struggle to find space or join a lobby in the first place. Since day 1 however, the amount of lobbies has tripled, and problems experienced have dropped significantly. The only concern this leaves me with now, is whether my opponents have a decent connection. With options to avoid poor connection opponents however, I'm not very concerned.


Final thoughts: It's clear to me that this game was never an after-thought. An incredible amount of love and labour has gone into this game, and the result is astounding. The game is far from over however with the promise of DLC to come. The in-game cutscenes can be compared directly with the anime and manga, shot for shot. A wide variety of game modes that can keep you entertained for hours at a time.

39778573,english,"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the Dragon Ball fighting game we have been waiting for since forever!
Brought to us by the fine folks at Arc System Works with the blessings of Bandai Namco the game features a decent cast of fan favorite characters with a few more newer additions from Super and even a brand new character! 

First off, the game takes cues from the Guilty Gear Xrd series, using Unreal Engine 3 to make 3D models into beautiful renditions of their anime counterparts. The gameplay is smooth and accessible, drawing comparisons to Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 with their own interpretations of such gameplay systems as 3v3 tag based gameplay, Snapbacks and X-Factor.
Yes, there are auto-combos, but these do very low damage usually and players who use them will be outlasted by players who have a better grasp of how to optimize their options. That being said, the game was made with an emphasis on accessiblity and a lot of things you may find out can be applied to many different characters across the roster.
I have yet to play the Story Mode in the game but I have heard it is an extensive exclusive story and judging by how long it has taken others I know to beat it, it seems pretty involved. It surely is a positive to see a company not neglect the singleplayer experience in a fighting game, especially one with such a deep and beloved lore.

The one thing that leaves a lot to be desired is the route they chose to go with the user interface with an ill advised lobby system that seems obtrusive and unnecessary. It seems that ArcSys seriously underestimated the response to this game on PC as on launch ( 44k+ concurrent users on Steam for a fighting game?! ) a lot of lobbies were full, preventing a lot of people from enjoying the game as soon as they possibly could. Simple menus and options leading into the lobbies would have been a better look but even the best things have their flaws but hopefully some things get done to improve the experience ( simple invitation system, menu based selections anyone?).

Back to the visuals though! They really did a great job optimizing the the whole game to run on many levels of PC hardware with resolutions ranging from 320x200 to the beautiful beast that is 4k! All in all, the porting was well done and should definitely be appreciated,

Pros

+ Great Port with many options for many differing levels of hardware.
++ Hits you right in the nostalgia with many recognizable characters and settings in full anime glory!
+++ Fast paced but accessible gameplay with enough options for more adept fighting gamers.
++++ Adequate singleplayer content on launch day in a genre not known for its singleplayer experiences
Cons

- Cumbersome online system that makes it very unintuitive to invite friends to a match among other things.
-- Slightly anemic roster with more characters to come later ( Not soon enoughhhhh!)
--- Expensive DLC!

THIS REVIEW IS EDITED. SEE THE ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.

While I wasn't a fan of the servers and UI at launch, things have settled down a bit now that the day one rush is over. 

DBFZ keeps things simple by making each memeber of a three man squad have about 3 to 4 moves with simple inputs. Team building, skill with each character, knowing more tech, and most importantly, NOT AUTO DASHING IN NEUTRAL 24/7 TO GET FACE FUCKED BY 2H ON REACTION, are all important skills in DBFZ. It's not too different from MvC3 with a bit of ArcSys flare thrown in. All in all, it's a damn good mix on top of looking great.

The literal sorcery done with the Unreal 3 engine (later ported to Unreal 4 which is what DBFZ runs on) has shown improvement over the last two entries of the Guilty Gear series and continues to have more of it's potential discovered on each project. 
As a result, DBFZ is a fantastic looking game with a borderline insane level of detail put in to make it faithful to the source material. Even to the point of recreating some of the more akward frames from the anime and manga for the sake of detail.

Story mode feels like a fun DBZ OVA that time forgot, although I might be biased in that statement as it is similar to the Android Arc of the anime. Which was my favorite arc in the series. What wasn't fun about story mode was having to fight through hours of ""Clone fighters"" of the cast on easy AI difficulty for the majority of the fights in DBFZ. 

I realize what this sounds like, but I honestly would have prefered DBFZ's story mode to be a big, in-game OVA like Guilty Gear. Alternatively they could have made a handfull of set ""boss"" versions of characters and put it on top of something akin to Guilty Gear's Medal of Millionare mode (commonly refered to as M.O.M. Mode). The story is fun, grinding through AI clones with auto combos to see the next part is not.

While I would still like ArcSys to make the lobbies more convienent and stick support to anything that isn't a Microsoft controller, pad, or stick is not complete. It would be foolish to pass up on this game for those reasons alone. Just be ready to deal with some questionable menu choices and have fun raising that power level.

Original Review
----
First thing's first. The game itself is fine and the second the issues I have with it are fixed I will change this review.

As the game is right now, the online is borderline unplayable. To access any online mode, you MUST be in an online lobby and your friends MUST be in the SAME online lobby as you. I am on the US East Coast and there are nowhere near as much lobby space as needed to support the game. 
There are only official lobbies and for the US East Coast only about 400 or so players can be on at once. My guess is that the average volume of people is probably closer to 40,000 at the absolute least.

Unlike Guilty Gear Xrd, all menus are through the lobby system. Both in online lobbies and offline. It makes things unclear even with the menu surfing option under ""Teleport"". 

You also cannot host private lobbies without being on one of the 64 man servers and anyone you invite MUST be on the same server. 

This NEEDS to be reworked entirely. My guess is Bamco was handling the servers this time around because I have no idea why they wouldn't just copy paste the convienent menus and lobbies from GGXrd. 

While I have not had this problem personally, as I use a fightpad. Apparently some arcade sticks do not register and keyboard support is not what one would consider full. I cannot comment anymore than that as I do not use a stick or a keyboard myself to play.

The game itself is fine, but a rework patch out of the gate is absolutely, 100% needed. Until then, I'd recomend waiting to buy this if you were planning to do so.",1517005137,1517456097,TRUE,1,1,0.518518567,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,654,14,1543,0,1323,1533774067

39757737,english,"This is an arcade style fighting game, where two players with three fighters each battle it until they've killed all of their opponent's fighters. If you've played Marvel vs Capcom, you'll know the kind of game I'm talking about.

Combos are key in a game like this, thankfully FighterZ goes easier on new players. Simply mashing face buttons grant auto combos, and while they aren't as optimal as specific varied inputs, they'll still let you hold your own.

Blocking is done just like MvC, holding away from your opponent, and down to block low sweeps. Guards can be broken with heavier attacks, character specific moves, or using Dragon Rush. This will send the opponent flying and lead you into an aerial combo chain.

Super Dashing will let you charge directly at your opponent and lead into a combo if they don't intercept, block, or reflect it. New players tend to spam this move, and the easiest defense is simply blocking and following it up.

Certain moves require Ki to use. You can your Ki at the bottom of the screen. This is built up by dealing or taking damage, blocking, or charging by holding your Ranged and Light attack buttons simeltaniously. Of course, this leaves you wide open. Pressing the medium and heavy attack buttons simeltaniously will teleport you into a heavy attack behind your enemy, although this costs one bar of Ki can be blocked by avid foes.

Super Moves can be autocomboed into by mashing medium attack on most characters, or dealt on a whim with a quarter circle forward and button input, depending on the character and move. At the cost of three Ki bars, quarter circle back and Dragon Rush will use a X3 super, dealing massive damage generally speaking. Although there are some exceptions, such as Ginyu's body swap.

Characters can be called in to initiate or compliment combos, or swapped to by holding the button. Upon dying, you'll automatically switch to the next character. Standard MvC mechanics.

Less standard are health mechanics. When you take damage, you'll have a blue bar left where some of your health used to be. Sending characters with recoverable HP to reserve will start them healing, certain specials can also heal off that damage, however most interesting is Sparking Mode. Useable once per match by pressing Dragon Rush and Super Dash simeltaniously, this move will make you quickly regenerate HP even whilst being combo'd.

And a mechanic that will likely never come into play in a real match, the Dragon Balls. Either player getting a 10 hit combo will summon the 1 star ball, 20 hit for 2 star, so on and so fourth up to a 70 hit combo for the 7 star ball. Or just, light hit auto combo your way to random dragon balls. Once all the dragon balls are summoned, a player with a maxed out Ki bar has to perform a basic light hit combo, at the end Shenron will be summoned to grant a wish. This lets you bring one of your teammates back to life, heal yourself, and other mechanics. Nothing utterly game breaking, but nothing to sneeze at either. Of course, considering the requirements, I doubt this mechanic will ever turn the tide of a match. It'd be awesome though.

If you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z like myself, you'll love this game's cutscenes. FighterZ is oozing with charm. Characters will talk and interact with one another as the characters would.

This is driven home even further in the game's story mode, featuring an original plotline. As you go through and find more fighters to add to your roster, they'll have banter and cutscenes with one another that'll make any fan of Dragon Ball Z smile.

Every single move, every single animation, even, is animated exactly like the show or manga. Not a single detail is misplaced. Reflecting away energy blasts will damage the enviroments, characters become visibly damaged over time, and finishing off fighters with heavy hits or powerful blasts will send them flying or destroy the terrain!

Even if you have never seen the show before, this is simply a good fighting game, with simple to pick up mechanics, a diverse roster, and a high skill ceiling. Ranked Mode will let you play against people competitively, to increase your rank. And as you play any of the gamemodes, you'll earn currency used to buy capsules. Don't worry, while they are basically loot boxes this game does not have ANY microtransactions, yet (fingers crossed), and nothing in the capsules effect gameplay. They contain colour sets for fighters, custom flair for your player's info card, and namely avatars, emotes and stamps for the game's lobby menu, where all of the gamemode selection takes place.

This leads me to one of my problems with this game, though. The lobby system is far and away, the worst one I have ever seen for a fighting game. You select your region, then a server set from your region. From there, you choose from one of several lobbies, each of which let you play different gamemodes against real people. However, these lobbies have player limits of 64 people, and the server regions are very vague. I mean, US EAST and US WEST, and, that's it. Same for Canada, and Mexico.

Back to the point, these lobbies are not a well thought out system. While there is an offline lobby option, you obviously can't play against anyone online from it, and you can't launch the game straight into an offline lobby. And if you want to play with your friends, you have to both manually find and join the same lobby, create a private match within it, navigate the clunky menus, and then start. You can't simply click ""join game.""

Aside from the inane server system, the gameplay itself is absolutely solid. I'm no fighting game expert, but every pro player I've seen try this game has liked it.

So, if you're looking for a fantastic 3v3 fighting game that is friendly to those new to the genre, with an active community, large roster and promise of at least 8 more characters in the future, via DLC mind you, FighterZ is a great choice. If you haven't watched the show before, well you should, but the game will likely be of interest regardless! I will admit though, if you hate Dragon Ball Z, you'll likely not be able to stand this game. It's filled with refrences, style, dialogue, and... japan-ness from the show, and it's a bit hard to ignore.

39753074,english,"[b] [u] [h1] Summary [/h1] [/u] [/b]
Dragon Ball FighterZ... An amazing fighting style game based on the original series's plot with some extras [spoiler](like the new character Android 21) [/spoiler] , a game which I would recommend to people who have watched the series it self or to old school players who have played 2D fighting games like Street Fighter or Tekken.

[b] [u] [h1] Plot [/h1] [/u] [/b]
The arcs in the game occurs sometime after the Universe 6 Saga story-line before the ""Future"" Trunks Saga in Dragon Ball Super.
The game has three arcs:
[b] The Super Warrior Arc where goku is the main character,
 The Enemy Warrior Arc  where Frieza is the main character
and the Android 21 Arc where Android 18 and 21 are the main characters, Each arc are similar when it comes to features but somewhat different when it comes to the story.
The main plot of the game is revealed in the Android 21 Arc. [/b]

[b] [u] [h1] Gameplay [/h1] [/u] [/b]
The gameplay borrows concepts from other fighting games, primarily the Marvel vs. Capcom series control scheme and team mechanics, with three primary attack buttons and one unique action buttons blus a few others. Unlike the Arc System Works-developed Extreme Butouden, FighterZ plays out in a scheme much closer to many other of the traditional Arc System Works.
Players each select three characters to form a team. One character is controlled, and can be switched with one of the other characters at any time. Players can also call one of their other characters to perform an ""Assist"" move, allowing simultaneous attacks and combos with the entire team. All three of a team's characters must be defeated for a match to end.
Other mechanics involve the usage of the auto-combo system utilized by fighting games as of Persona 4: Arena (tap one button for an automatic preset combo), which now also applies to the medium attack button as well (giving all characters two auto-combos). Forward + medium attack is also a universal overhead attack for all characters, which cannot be chained out of.
Nearly all characters are also planned to have differing playstyles/archetypes apart from each other akin to more contemporary fighting games as opposed to using recycled base movesets such as in the Budoukai games.
An Instant Kill-like cutscene known as “Dramatic Finish” is only on two certain characters, if one of them won the match.

[spoiler] LootBoxes [/spoiler]
In the game you have the ability to buy loot boxes i.e. ""Z Capsules"", these loot boxes are unlockable with the in-game currency named zeni, earned through winning matches, completing challanges and chapters and more. When a player receives  a duplicate item, it is transformed into another type of currency - the Premium Z Coin. As with zeni, these coins are not purchasable with real-life money. Ten Premium Z Coins can be exchanged for a single, non-duplicate item of the player's choice.

39751708,english,"TL:DR:  Some online connection issues that are game-breaking for MP at present, but if they fix them; this game will be one of the best fighters ever made, and an absolute must-have for DB fans.

This game is an absolutely excellent, fun, streamlined, well-polished triple A fighter.  It is a complete joy for fans of Dragonball Z.  The story mode, while I found it a bit slow at first, has truly grown on me.  The premise is a bit silly, but the voice-acting, animation, and the dialogue itself is amazing!   The online lobby is cute, functional, and probably works for someone:

Therein lies my only problem with Dragonball FighterZ so far: the online connection.   I get booted from lobbies almost as soon as I join them; it was fine yesterday, and terrible today.  I get booted from matches for no apparent reason.  My internet is broadband and can manage seven megabytes down and at least one up.   I've heard rumor that it might be because I'm operating on wifi.  Setting the game up to require a hardline ethernet connection is kind of crap in the modern age (I do not encounter this problem on other fighters online).  I hope the devs fix this soon.  

More impressions: story mode is too easy, but fun.  Arcade mode is properly challenging.  The few PvP fights I've managed to get all the way through were very fun, even if I felt like I was getting juggled a lot.  That's my fault for not learning the very accessible assist/combo system.   There is no chat in-game, so there are no trolls or flamers to encounter.  Instead all you have is the option to customize various preset messages and stamps to create cute little emotes.  I think it's rather genius.   

People are complaining that there is no way to directly invite a friend to a match, that's true.  If you want to play with your friend online you'll need to both join the same lobby, and create a ring match to play each other.   This probably isn't nearly as difficult as people are making it out to be, except for the infuriating connection issues.   

If they fix their wonky servers, this game will be the best Dragonball game to ever have been made, not to mention a superb fighter that is very addictive and fun.   I look forward to seeing this game blossom into an esport.

The learning curve makes this game a challenge that keeps you coming back for more. Love everything about it as a fan of the fighter genre and as a childhood fan of the anime series. Damn near perfect! 5/5 stars, would definitely recommend to DBZ fans, or fighter enthusiest! One side note the price point at $60 does make it a little steep but it pays for itself in satisfaction, I will wait for the DLC price to drop ($35 for 8 characters?

39742173,english,"This game is a blast. You don't have to be hardcore into DBZ, you don't have to be hardcore into fighting games. 

The game is fast, colorful, the animations are fluid and beautiful. It's  easy to pick up, you can pull of some badass and useful moves right away, but learning to string them together in the most effective and brutal ways will take you time. And learning to juggle in the assists from the other members of your team can make you extra deadly. There's a lot to master in this game.

You sign in to a lobby, a little dbz village where you can walk around with 64~ other people, challenge each other, put on ring matches (multiple people can join up, watch ongoing fights, queue to fight winner etc) spend zeni coins (the in game currency you earn as you fight and complete content or do daily tasks), watch replays, or access any of the games many modes and features.

The story is actually fun! You progress through maps with multiple paths, you can fight every fight or choose a more direct path to the boss battle that progresses the story and moves you to the next map. Fighting more fights means you level fighters, earn more rewards (coins, powerups that increase damage/exp etc during storymode), and have potential to see some dialog you might not otherwise. The story mode fights take time to become challenging. Eventually you will lose one and start learning how to counter/guard effectively and not charge in. I felt like the curve was enough that it didn't frustate me but I didn't get bored before I started having to think a bit more.

Training modes are both fun and useful. Combo challenges are a blast and will help make you a better and more competetive player. Grab your favorite chracter and go through a 10 point progression from easy single button combos up to challenging strings of moves that really fuck shit up. You'll be rewarded for your time and effort. There's also a general battle training to take you through the game basics,  and the sort of freeplay training you'd expect with CPU settings, damage/hit data that's useful to serious players.

Dragon Ball Fighterz is a 2.5D fighting game developed by Arc System Works, known mostly for Guilty Gear and BlazBlue. Unlike a majority of modern Dragon Ball games which were more like fun brawlers and Dragon Ball fanfic machines, DBF is a very competent fighting game with a weighty roster and a few neat modes to keep you busy.

Play as your favorite characters such as Fightman, Manlet, Big Green, Kid Fightman, Triclops, Real Estate Agent, Chromosome Snatcher, Forehead #18, and who could forget: Fightman but shorter.

Once you start the game you are introduced to a lobby where you choose your avatar before you head out. From here you can pick modes ranging from story to arcade to ranked and casual matches to arena mode, which is basically the ultimate turf fight. Its nice to have a fighting game with all of its options actually fleshed out and ready to play from launch, unlike a few certain other games that came out with missing features.
Its like ordering a pizza and only getting the coke.
The story mode is surprisingly weighty, being a mix of fighting game and visual novel. Though that's par for the course with Arc Systems, they even went out of their way to make a brand new story instead of just treading old ground. Even going as far as to add a new character who I may or may not have a little boy crush on. 
Its refreshing to see your favorite characters on a new adventure instead of just treading old ground over and over again.
Xenoverse could learn a lot from this. 

Something that Arc Systems really did well on is the sense of scale. These are some powerful dudes and ladies, even the weakest one is probably strong enough to blow up a planet at this point. So you get special animations for beating an opponent with certain moves, like giant beam attacks treat you to a zoom out to show just how big these attacks are, some of them even leave the planet. There are also finishers that launch your opponent through a mountain. Or into space.
He's not coming back.

Most of the characters share the same button commands, which makes it easier to memorize specials and combo enders. But at the same time its kind of lame that there isn't a character for certain play styles, so charge character players are basically a left out. 

The game also has an auto-combo feature for easing new players into the genre. Don't rely too much on it though or you're going to get bodied.
I mean, you're going to get bodied anyway, so you know what I mean. I get bodied.
I also cry often. 

It all melds together and helps the player adjust to playing a team of three characters. Since there isn't much difference in commands, you end up learning your characters quickly, a hopefully improving as you climb the ranks. Or just stop playing after getting beaten up by a man with the Steam name of Pedro Mustachio, I don't care.
There are a few problems, at least on launch. Finding a game, ranked or otherwise takes so long I may as well review this game while I wait for a match. I also can't seem to play with friends, or some friends at least. For some reason we're given a “This game is full message” when we try to play in a room together, even if its just the two of us. 
Other than that and a few frame hiccups, the game is absolutely solid. 

Dragon Ball Fighterz is a [strike]raging[/strike]blast to play. It captures the fury, the scale, and the adrenaline of the series in a way we haven't seen since the Budokai Tenkaichi games. It doesn't hold back, it plays Dragon Ball straight and doesn't dilute it at all. If the more toned down games decided to let loose like DBF does then we'd probably have some kind of crazy Dragon Ball game renaissance on our hands.

DBF is in love with it's source material, and that's not something you can say for very many games. If you're looking for a new fighting game, a new Dragon Ball game, or just a new Dragon Ball story. At least give this a check out.

39738607,english,"This game's multiplayer is definitely annoying, but you can still do most of the functions of the game by pressing Y (probably another key I don't know of if you're using keyboard) to go to an offline lobby.

Offline Gameplay:

[b]FINOMINAL[/b]. This is definitely worth getting, especially if you plan on playing a lot of single player. The story mode is an easy 10 hours for all 3 arcs if you defeat the least amount of enemies possible (but can get repetitive if you try to defeat everything), and a challenging arcade mode and loot system just ready for you to dig your hands into! There's plenty of gameplay to be had offline.

In addition, there's a practice mode where you can learn how to do the combat in this game, combo challenges, and more. There's a local battle as well for those who want to 1v1 friends, or create a tournament using the tournament feature, which is definitely finominal if you need to warm up, or just wanna go against random CPUs consecutively.

Online Gameplay:


I'm gonna split this up so you know where it's good and bad. [b]Note that this is the main problem in the game.[/b]

CONS:
There are about 12 lobbies on average for each region (based off North America). Each can hold up to 64 players, and is generally hogged pretty quickly, especially when those in your region aren't working/sleeping. The main problem with this, is that most people go onto the online lobbies, but don't participate in online activites, like Ring Matches, Arena Matches, and Casual and Ranked Matches (for more info, see pros). But what do they do then?

Instead, they do things like arcade and practice mode, while staying on the lobby, both of which can easily be done offline, and easily hogs up space for those who want to play online. The problem won't be completely hindered, but if they kicked you offline for using any of these modes, just like they [i]kind of[/i] do with story mode, the problem is majorly hindered.

[b]My main point is that they need to keep matches online, and keep all the other features offline to save space for those using online, and the game will be much better multiplayer wise.[/b]

PROS:
From Arena Matches to Ring Matches, there is definitely fun to be had in multiplayer, if you can get in and not get kicked out. Here's each of the modes:

Arena Matches: Have a match with someone else on the server quickly! Talk to the man right to the announcments to jump in, and go against others! (I recommend ring matches more, however)

Casual Matches: Jump into a casual match, and it's exactly like a ranked match, except there's no rank, and you can go against pretty much anyone, rather than a rank based choice. Speaking of which,

Ranked Match: A 1v1 with some random person on the internet also playing FighterZ that's most likely in the same region, but sometimes you end up with more, but it's based on your settings, really. Go against someone against your skill, or higher, [b]if you dare.[/b] This does count towards your win/loss ratio, and if you want to get rid of that Saibamen ranking on your player card, [b]play some ranked matches and rank up.[/b]

Ring Match: The most flexible online match making system in Fighterz. Set up mini tournaments, 1v1s with your friends, specific battles in specific orders, 3v3 with each player being one character, it's got it all! The only requirement is that you have to be on the same server as the person/people who are going to play, and they have to walk over to you to join. [b]Too much effort, if you ask me.[/b]


-----------

That being said, singleplayer gameplay, although the story can be a bit repetitive, is pretty great, and can help you get started in mastering the game/the characters you want to play. (9/10)

The multiplayer can be annoying, but it's not as hard as people give it out to be, [b]except during rush hour on weekends.[/b] But overall, the multiplayer gameplay is excellent. (7/10)

Although this wasn't a review of the actual game mechanics, I'll leave that to someone else; I'm clarifying the multiplayer and singleplayer situations. If I ever go into more detail, it'll most likely be game mechanics or DLC.

Enjoy the game if you buy!

Feels too much like a REPEAT of XENO with the whole posession thing. EXCEPT for the part of cloning ofc. But yea the only reason im playing the story right now is to improve AND to get the achievements oh and ofc to watch the sexci cut scenes. It seems like they RUSHED the story PLOT but took GOOD time on cut scenes. The multiplayer of FighterZ is VERY good actually, smooth play, Never ever disconecct. I like the whole RANK system where you start from earthling rank and make your way up to SSGSS kaioken x20, that was a nice touch to the ranking system. The customization in multiplayer is above average, VERY good indeed. Would of been nice to have auras in the HUB but oh well still cool without. But yea a VERY good 2d Dragonball game OVERRALL. definitely my favourite 2d dragonball game, STILL doesn't beat Xeno for lack of content which is understandable since it is ONLY 2d and Xeno is 3d so they have alot more to work around.

39737396,english,"Let me start off by saying that just like probably 80% of everyone, I also grew up with DBZ. I've always been a fan and played a lot of the old DBZ games, for example DBZ Budokai 3 for the PS2 which I will compare this game to a lot. 

DBZ Budokai 3 has the same 2D fighting style as FighterZ and the preview videos made it look like a new and better version of Budokai 3 (that's what I was expecting). However. I like to call this game an early access version of Budokai 3. I will list some things here that I find note worthy:

- You can't go super saiyan. Frieza can turn gold for a short time but other than that, you can't transform anything.
- There is very few characters to choose from. There are currently 24 characters available. I read that you can get 8 more characters if you're willing to pay $35 for the season pass. Since you can't transform anything except from Frieza, this is very disappointing.
- Every character that has the ability to turn super saiyan (storywise) is already super saiyan. For example, you can't play as normal Vegeta, only as Vegeta SSj1 or SSGSS which are 2 seperate characters to choose between. Same goes for Goku which also has Black Goku as seperate character, but characters like Trunks are always SSJ1.
- It feels like a huge insult that you're able to get lobby characters which you can only run around with, which you can't get as actual fighting characters. For example Cell's other forms, Frieza's other forms, Majin Vegeta and side characters like Saibaman etc.
- The combat system is super flawed. For example the other day I shot a beam at my friend and right before it hit, he did an attack aswell. We both watched as my beam clipped straight through his body without damaging him, while his attack continued at hit me. This happens A LOT. 
- There is very few defence mechanics in the game. So there really is not much you can do vs button mashers.
- The controls are very easy and bland. This combined with the flawed defence system make it so that your biggest chance at winning, is to look which character has the range/speed and spamming light/medium attack untill you win. 
- The story arcs are extremely boring. You're forced to fight countless clones of the same 3-4 character over and over while you play a different weird story 3 times which is about the same characters (?). 
- During the story cutscenes in the story arcs, the animations are garbage. The movement of the characters is often very stiff and laggy. I checked if my frames dropped because of the laggy characters, but it really is just the animation. The walking animations are also ridiculous. The feet move faster than they travel. The main lobby of the game has this same problem with the feet.
- The main lobby is boring and there really is not much to do there.
- If you're sick of the button mashers in online, and you've completed the 3 short story arcs, then too bad. There is nothing else to do except training or fighting an NPC. 
- There are a lot of issues with hitboxes in this game. For example, Goku reaching farther than his arm/leg and some attacks just failing to connect.

Now that I've listed some poor things about FighterZ, I will name some things that Budokai 3 has, and this game was made in 2004:
- There are 42 playable characters. You need to unlock most of them.
- The story mode consists of 11 characters, all with their own story and actual enemies to fight instead of the same clone again and again.
- During the story mode you can fly around over the Earth with various things to do like searching for items or searching for hidden stuff to unlock characters. 
- These 42 characters make for many more variations because of the tranformations. For example as Goku you can go all the way up to SSJ4 and even then you can fuse with Vegeta. 
- The combat system has more options since you can choose which attacks/items your chosen character has during a fight. You can even upgrade and unlock more skills from for example the shop.
- The fighting is way more balanced and broad. For example if both players both do a kamehameha at the same time, they will clash in which an event will start where you have to mash a button to win the clash. 
- There are items in-game that can be used during a fight or that simply boost your stats, for example as Vegeta you can equip a Majin thingy that transforms you into Majin Vegeta when you reach low hp.
- The in-game shop is a really fun way to gain new skills, items and costumes. 
- You can change how many HP bars both parties have. This makes it so that your fight doesn't end within 2 seconds and you can actually make it an epic battle with transforming etc. 

They made an HD rendered version called Dragon Ball Z: Budokai HD Collection which includes Budokai 1 and 3 for either the PS3 or the Xbox 360. I really recommend you buy that bundle instead of FighterZ. It will save you like $40 and gives you way more content to play with. I also really recommend Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 which was made for the PS2 and the Wii. This game has 161 playable characters (yes I'm serious) including a lot of characters which were solely made for this game. For example the Saiyans' Great Ape forms. This game has a 3D fighting style which I also really enjoyed back in the day on the Wii. 

Conclusion:
Don't buy FighterZ. We have already seen with Xenoverse and Xenoverse 2 that the devs are really lazy and lacking their original creativity. The older games are cheaper and offer A LOT more content. FighterZ only has 3 things that are better than the old games: The game is new so it has the new characters in it (Hit, beerus, Goku&Vegeta SSGSS). The graphics are obviously better than the old games (I don't know how good the HD rendered version of the old games look). It's available on PC which is Master race.

- amazing graphics
- great fighting game mechanics that feel fresh
- epic battles against your friends
- even when you are losing u have a chance to come back
- fun story mode
- great local versus play

Cons
- expensive with the fighterZ pass
- online lobbies are pretty shit and badly designed
- you will have connectivity issues if you don't set your steam region to the server you enter
- people in ranked like to disconnect from the internet and ragequit so they don't lose points
- i really wished the villain in this was a bit more original than a female looking buu...
- inviting a friend to fight you online isn't as simple as  ""invite friend to match""

39735377,english,"Holy shit this game is awesome. I haven't had this much fun in not only a fighting game, but a Dragon Ball game in a long ass time. Not to mention the fact that I actually win online in this game. :O

Anyway imma list Pros and Cons to save anyone reading some time. 

NOTE: A common misconception is that this a game for DBZ fansm and while that is true, its a fighting game first, and a Dragon Ball game second. 

Pros:
+This game is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, I almost splooged the first time I saw a super attack.
+ Combat is fun and simple, without feeling too repetitve.
+Net code is the best i've experienced. Frame delay is almost non-existent in most cases.
+3v3 is actually a cool and exciting concept.
+Story mode length and concept are really cool. (Finally a unique DBZ story lol)
+Modes are challenging and diverse
+Loot! But fair and no impact on gamplay, simply spend some Zeni (which is easily obtained) and hope you get something you want. You can unbox Lobby characters, colors, Z-stamps, etc. Feels rewarding
+Easter eggs/references. My god... if you're a diehard DBZ fan, play this game and figure out some of the Dramatic finishes... pls
+Stages are unique, fleshed out, even destructible enviornments.
+The music is incredible! Actually this game some of my favorite music in a DBZ I think.
+Story mode is hilarious.
+Linking with characters feels really rewarding, deepening connections with characters you sometimes don't even care about
+Android 21 is T H I C C

Cons:
-Story mode and its dialougue feel off. Sometimes it just doesn't mesh and I feel like characters lines are useless and only waste time, but can be funny.
-Fighting the clones in the story mode can feel really repetetive.
-Story mode animations 
-Artificial difficulty is annoying when climbing arcade (ie. the AI doing more damage just because, but still being brain dead)
-Android 21's voice actor in English is REALLY annoying.
-Getting into an Online Lobby can be a hassle if too many people are playing, especially Canada.
-The main lobby could use some ""lively"" attention. It feels stale pretty quickly.



Other than that this is one of the most fun games i've ever played.

39734429,english,"Excellent game, but not perfect.

The pros:
-Awesome fighting mechanics, very marvel vs capcom style, with a bit of Guilty Gear formula.
-Excellent visuals, they are even betteer than the TV show. Best graphics ever for a DBZ game, by difference.
-All fighters have their moveset very well inspired on the manga and tvshow.
-Lots of stuff for online and offline mode (story mode took me about 15 hours to complete). The AI in arcade mode is soo hard to beat.
-24 different, unique and well balanced characters.

The cons:
-I don't like the fucking lobby oriented menus. Why, why they force you to enter the lobby, even if I don't have any intention to use online modes?? I would prefer a classic menu interface.
-Story mode is a bit unnecessarily large. Sometimes gets boring,. I think they could have made it in 8 hours, with less useless and repetyitive combats (the combats in story mode are very easy), and I think it would have been better to have a unique arc instead of having 3 differents arcs which sometimes have some incongruences between them.
-It would have been waaay better if arcade mode had some type of cinematic, credits, exclusive galleries when you beat it, you know, sime type of... story, like there has always been in fighters games.

In conclusion, this game:
-Is a dream come true if you're a fighting game enthusiast and a Dragon ball fan.
-Is a must have if you're a fighting game enthusiast.
-Is a must have if you're a Dragon Ball fan but never played a REAL fighting game (xenoverse, tenkaichis and other Dragon ball games are not fighting games sorry). The game offers gameplay mechanics so you can have fun from day 0 even if you're not familiar with the genre. You'll have to learn a lot to win in online battles of course, but that's another story...

Campaign is fully voiced, has tons of dialogue and content, and this one of the few fighters that lets newbie players learn easily and pick up on how to get better at these kind of games without being itself easy. 

Graphics are gorgeous, seriously this looks better than the show and recreates moments you've seen in the show naturally and fluidly, and that's wonderful for fans

But this game is worth the hype. when I heard this game was being made I was skeptical; until I saw that Arc systems was making it, and immediately became hyped. If you want a masterful 2D fighting game than none come close to Arc. 10/10.

-Now that the line skimmers are out of the way, some issues. For one the player roster is a bit small in my opinion especially for the game mode which is a 3v3. if this game had a 1v1 than it wouldn't be so bad, but having 6 characters of a 21 character roster being used every battle makes the selection slim. what makes it even worse is the fact that this game comes after tenkaichi 3 which had every concievable character in it from the show. So the list was reduced on purpose and turned into bullshit ""if you want more fighters get the season pass."" In summary the list is small for the 3v3 battles; and if you don't think so go play Marvel v Capcom and just see the large roster.
-Another issue with this game is a problem that I found while playing. There are no combo breakers to my knowledge. This wouldn't be so bad in some fighting games, but a game like this where you can get a 30hit combo than switch to another character to get another without a respite for the opponent just seems like shit. Just for the haters I'm not bringing this up because I suffered this problem (which I did) but I bring it up because I have inflicted this same abuse on opponents and wiped entire teams without suffering any damage.
-Story mode is Eh. Maybe it's because I went straight into ranked, but the story mode had no challenge at all. I literally blew right through it. Not to mention it has the same problem that all fighting game stories have, it's just an excuse for characters to fight. which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't Dragon Ball, the show made for characters to just fight.

[u]Arc System Works[/u] has created a fighting masterpiece. Dragon Ball FighterZ may very well be the best fighting game on the market. 

From the gorgeous hand drawn artwork, to the extremely tight gameplay mechanics, all the way down to the fine details of the character banter. It is all spot on.

[b]Meeeeeeeeee---![/b]

However, there are a few minor annoyances. Nothing is perfect in this world, not even Cell. 
The way they handled the Lobby system and match making could be a little better. Disconnects are abundant and during the launch of the game there was no where near enough lobbies open for everyone to play online.

That being said, it is not game breaking. They've already fixed the lobby issue by adding more. 

[b]Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa---![/b]

I had to get that one negative aspect of the game out of the way, because this game is loaded with positive things to talk about.

I'll be real with you.. I am absolutely terrible at fighting games. I purchased Dragon Ball FighterZ simply because of my love for Dragon Ball and the artwork of the game looked exactly like the anime series. 

DBFZ has done for me, what no other fighting game has ever been able to do. It [i]makes[/i] me want to get better at the game, and it gives me every single tool I need to do so. The easy Story mode is a nice way to start off after you've practiced and practiced in training mode and after rewatching your fights over and over. You can also head over to Arcade Mode where things get a bit tougher, before you finally decide to take the plunge into online Casual and Ranked Matches.

[b]Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee---![/b]

I have a strong feeling this game will be around for a long time and celebrated among the Fighting community and loved on Twitch. The art style has me believing it will never age. As with other fighting games such as Tekken or Street Fighter, those pixelated games don't age very well visually. 

Seriously, if you are a Fighting Game fan, you should already own this. If you are a solid Dragon Ball Z fan, definitely check this out.  

+ The art style is very pleasing and almost identical to the actual anime
+ The mechanics of the game are so tight and smooth. Easy to play, but very, [i]very[/i] hard to master
+ You get a plethora of characters to choose from. Each with their own conversations and banter
+ There is a ton of customization as well. It's locked behind loot boxes, but these loot boxes are acquired from actually playing the game

Not because of the game itself, but because of community surronding it. I've been a lover of fighting games, and dragon ball Z games for a long time now and nastalgia is what really made me get the game, that and from what seemed to be a competent fighting game dev. 

The story was, well what you would expect it to be -- pretty awful, not much point to it other than some fanservice 2/10

The combat.. The combat was amazing, easy to get into, but a lot you could figure out and master. top notch 10/10

The graphics are what you'd expect them to be, it looks like dragon ball. Although i felt like the cinematics felt off. Just didn't look right to me, could have been some monitor issues at the time though. 7/10 

The community is probably one of the only bad things about this game, you have the rabid fan boys of DBZ which are w/e they are tolerable. But then you have people who are rabid FGC fan boys, who take things way to seriously. Kinda kills the vibe. 

At the end of the day, if you are looking for a dragon ball z game to throw down with your friends. This will be your smoothest and best experience.

Pros:
- Looks Good
- Feels Great to play 
- Decent Roster
- Multiplayer matches feel smooth and fairly lag free (If you can get in a lobby.)

Cons:
-Lack of servers for online 
(this is a big CON cause the game is mainly online. *As a work around My friend and i just played in a japan lobby which ran smooth with no lag*)
-No private mutiplayer. (its alittle annoying to have to join a public lobby and set up a locked ring. Would have been nice if there was just a direct connect private multiplayer that functioned like the local VS mode with the player select screen and all)

Odds are the server stiuation will work its self out in the next few days or so. I'd expect them to see the demand and try and meet it. 

*edit*
like literally the next morning they added a bunch more servers. I haven't had any trouble getting into online lobbies since day 2. Plus as far as lag in matches i haven't really experienced that much. No where near as bad as some matches ive had in USF4. only the occasional hiccup here and there, but that was more likely cause i was playing on wifi at the time.

- Statisfying roster. I don't feel I need more characters to ""buy"".

Cons:
- daunting for a newbie. Online can be brutal for a newcomer.
- tutorials is not as informative, there is so much to find out about that the game will not tell you. 

Long Version:
 
Wow.... this is probably the best fighting game I've played in a long time. 

A bold statement, and there is a little bias because it features characters from my favorite anime Dragonball Z and Super. Yet, hear me out.

I've played and mastered most fighting games out there, MVC series, Street Fighter series, Virtua Fighter, DOA, Tekken, Smash Bros, you name it I most likely played it (hurts my wallet too). Honestly, I've become a little fatigued as nothing really feels fresh or new. Not to mention, paying more for DLC is a major killer for me as I've already spent full price for most the games that I mentioned. 

Dragonball Fighter Z takes me back to a time when I played guilty gear back in 2001, and said ""wow, I wish Dragonball characters were in this."" Now 17 years later, my wish came true and even though it comes off as a button masher it is much more than that.

What really makes this game is that each character is a blast to use, and while mashing a few buttons pulls off some of the coolest animations I've ever seen in a fighting game, you'll notice a much more rewarding experience by going farther  by mixung up combo's of your own. It's so rewarding to practice combo's in the training room, and then using them online against people or even the CPU on hard. The characters are quite balanced, and while it doesn't seem like that after playing your first online match and getting wrecked,  you'll come to find that every character can be countered. Example, while I was playing 3v3, this buu kept wrecking me and my friend. I realized that buu is a medium ranged character and he consistently used the same combo. So, I countered him with a solid projectile character like Trunks by damaging him with some ki blasts and following up with some solid combos to deal some damage. It's moments like that, that are so rewarding and keeps you at the edge of your seat. 

The animations, the character voices (japanese and english), the music, are all amazing and is everything I've wanted in a Dragonball fighting game! I have nothing but praise for this game and is a game that Dragonball fans have been waiting for and deserve!

In conclusion, if you love fast paced fighting games like marvel vs capcom 3 and anime like Dragonball, and are willing to put in the time to master the characters, you will find an excellent and rewarding game that is worth every penny!",1517307632,1517307632,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,408,18,1495,0,1032,1518856036

FighterZ is still very much a multiplayer online classic fighting game though, and there's plenty of things to do, though I have been too impatient to start fights with players. you can train combos, go through an arcade mode, go through tournament style modes classic to Dragonball fighting games or just laze around in the game's online lobby. 
once you feel like taking the training wheels off, you'll find combos can be built from one button but there is an incredible amount of depth to getting past your opponent's block, forcing others to let their guard down and using teams effetively. 
I'm a massive dragonball fan, and you might have to be to know who the characters are, what special attacks they are likely to have and make sense of the relationships between characters in story mode, but if you've played games from this particular developer you'd be able to jump straight into the fighting without having to know too much about dragonball.

39721829,english,"This review coming from someone with very MINIMAL experience in the fighting genre. You can say, entry level.

The lastest fighting game I've played was Street Fighter X Tekken, and although I enjoyed it, I couldn't find myself investing much time into the game. SFxT just didn't hook it for me in the end so I never got out of the button mashing habit.

Now being a DBZ fan, I decided to give this one a shot after following it for awhile before release. The art style is fantastic and gives that DBZ feel when you're playing. Game offers a variety of modes such as Story, Arcade, Ranked Match, Arena, etc etc. If you haven't figured it out, this title is 2 player 3v3 with tagging mechanics.

You can play locally with a friend if you like, and set up private ""Ring"" matches in the lobby (the lobby being a hub in a sense) with certain conditions.

Though I haven't tried it, apparently you can even have 6 players in a match with each controlling a single character which is pretty cool.

As mentioned before, I'm very entry level when it comes to fighting games, but unlike SFxT...this game seems to just settle in just right for me. So I've invested time in ""Practice"" and various combo challenges that each character has. With further help from the community on the forums...I have to say, I'm actually pulling off some pretty cool combos and its almost becoming second nature to me already.

This game does have built in ""auto"" combos which I feel is nice for newer players like myself, though I noticed veterans of this genre to be completely against this mechanic. I'm glad its there as it helps players stay somewhat competitive if they are newer. In the mean time, they can work out disciplining themselves out of the habit as I have to pull off some pretty cool combos.

As mentioned, the game offers a variety of things to do, though I feel $60 is a bit high from what I've experienced. Unless you're a die hard fan of DBZ and love fighting games then you should consider it. Everyone else should wait for a sale, I'm feeling $40 is a better price for what the game currently offers.

There are ""lootboxes"" in the form of capsules which is straight from the anime. Every thing is cosmetic ranging from lobby characters to customization options for your card...like titles, backgrounds, frames, etc. Currency is Zeni, which again, isn't a surprise...to buy these capsules and I've been getting a fair amount rather easily playing Arcade.  It keeps you engaged and doesn't feel like a grind while your playing the game and/or sharpening your skills.

If you're new to the genre, I can say that this is a good title to get your feet wet and it seems others agree. Stay away from the keyboard and get a controller, I use a plug in play Xbox 360 controller. 

The title offers a JAP dub for those who prefer that over ENG dub for the voices. The characters sound and feel legit in terms of their personality, though for some reason Bulma feels a tad bit off for me, but its fine. Sometimes characters will reference the other in combat which is a nice little touch, though it could be better to make it feel more alive.

The stages are ""destructible"", but its rather limited, nothing too amazing honestly.

Overall, its a solid title for what it is. No doubt new characters will be added. In the mean time the current roster is good enough and will take time for players to master them, and see who synergizes with who and make a good team of 3.

This game is VERY good and I still have yet to become bored of it. If I'm being entirely honest the story mode is a huge waste of potential, relying on flinging a bunch of nameless clones your way and calling it a day. There's virtually no investment and, all things considered, very little to spoil. It's like playing through a run of the mill filler arc.

The GAMEPLAY, however, is what you're here for, and I'm surely not the only one to tell you it does not disappoint at all. While the roster is somewhat small, each character brings something new to the table and is drastically different. 

Honestly it's just a mastuhpieace. Play it cucks.

Lobby system, had some issues... it DOES have issues. They've improved on things and I think they actually were made aware of the PC community and based on the post-update they are listening.
I am glad I CANCELED my REFUND.

For those still having issues... there's gotta be some explanation for it... There are some decent/helpful subreddits that have posts with similar issues -- there may be more solutions there.

Thank you ARCSystem Works. You nailed it with this one.

This game had a lot more depth than auto combos  and single press button functions -- in fact -- knowing WHEN to actually employ an auto combo is something of itself... but you figure all that out on your own when you buy this expensive glossy DLC incoming game -- don't buy the DLC until you know what's coming -- the base game - is solid - even with 24 characters = they all somehow coming out different while having similar button patterns.

39651746,english,"Great game for both veteran and  casual newcomer fans alike of traditional 2D fighting games. The game has an inbuilt (but sadly cannot disable) [i] Auto-Combo [/i] function in which you need only to press one button to pull off advanced combos. However, the game still highly rewards players who utilise a regular combo by achieving higher DPS which encourages players to overcome this steep learning curve in order to improve and take on harder opponents.

The game also features a Ranked Mode where players can test their might against one another without holding back in order to determine their rightful rank and to see how high they can climb within the community. [b] Not a fan of serious competition? No problem. [/b] The game has plenty of Casual Matchmaking modes which allow even the greenest novices to be matched up with their rightful counterpart whilst still able to retain a fighting chance in order to provide an overall fun experience for players of all skill levels.

Unlike the Xenoverse franchise, the game is aimed more towards the mechanical/competitive gaming community whilst still managing to appeal to casual players (all them button mashers who like to spam one button) with the Auto-Combo function. Each character has their own unique moveset and mastering them requires patience, practice and skill and is highly rewarding and satisfying especially if you manage to pull it off right. Plus, the feeling of pulling off a Manual combo is so satisfying in comparison to just spamming one button for an Auto-Combo which can get pretty boring.

The story mode is unique and original featuring familiar characters (both old and new) and an all new character developed by the original creator of the Dragon Ball series himself: [i] Akira Toriyama. [/i]

[b] Keyboard controls are supported and are able to be rebinded, however A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as this makes it much easier to play the game and pull off more advanced combos. [/b]

My own personal experience and opinions:
- No problems so far in terms of PC optimisation and graphical bugs. Stunning visuals on max settings!
- Appeals to hardcore fans of the Dragon Ball series.
- Sadly, limited amount of lobbies per server. (Up to 64 per lobby, however there is a worldwide matchmaking option, although keep in mind if one person has bad connection, the game will purposely utilise a frame delay in order to ensure one player does not have an advantage over the other).
- I don't think $59.99 USD is a justifiable price range, maybe more of a $25-$30. I'd recommend  either waiting for a sale or buying only if you are truly a hardcore fan of Dragon Ball.",1517051608,1517287113,TRUE,3,0,0.523809552,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,320,32,3396,0,1682,1590233581

The game is gorgeous, I'm amazed ArcSys took their 2.5D visual style introduced in Guilty Gear XRD and pushed it to new heights. 

Every character feels believably accurate to their iterations in the anime/manga to a certain degree. Power levels don't play a role in balancing and it feels FANTASTIC to whoop ass with Yamcha. The game controls like a goddamn dream with a very accessible surface level, but there's a very deep and intricate combo system within the game that makes it a fantastic game for casuals and hardcore fighting game fans.

Original Review: Disregard this unless you're having connection problems as well, which hopefully the fix above works
______________________________________________________________________________
Was hyped asf for this game for months, everything about it seemed like it was exactly what i wanted from a dragon ball fighting game. Finally on release day I get on with some friends and we learn the game and try out 1v1 ring battles and everything is great regarding the gameplay itself. 

But these connection problems are a serious f*cking problem that SHOULD NOT EXIST. Most times you join a lobby it disconnects you for no reason within a couple minutes. It's impossible to play ranked or casual matches because 9 times out of 10 the f*cking connection issues box pops up, and then the one time you can actually get into a fight it disconnects you right in the middle of it. This isn't a problem on my end with my internet its 100% on the other end and they need to get their sh*t together because having unplayable servers in unacceptable for a game that I put $60 into.

It's welcoming to new players and even if you don't want to play multiplayer there's actually quite a bit to keep you entertained, especially if you are a completionist or Dragonball fan. 

Now the categories

Story: This is probably the weakest aspect of the game. While the story itself is fun and explains how all of these fighters can fight at the same level (a la Injustice), and even the cinematics are fun, the execution kills it. For one, you have to hit a button to go to the next piece of dialogue majority of the time, but sometimes doing so will interrupt the action and you will miss what happened (to be fair you can kind of tell which scenes you should wait on, but still). The second bad thing is that the fights are just booooooooooooooooooooring. As in the enemy will basically just sit there while you pummel him. At first my goal was to defeat everyone on a given map, but eventually got so bored with the fights almost wished there was an autoresult button. 

Gameplay: Simple to learn, somewhat easy to become amatuer, and not even that difficult to master once you have some practice. I guess the best way to say it is simplicity with depth. 

Production Values: AMAZING. That's really all I can say. You have both the Japanese and English subs, flashy effects straight from the show, and sound that was basically ripped straight from the anime as well. Not to mention the fan service thrown in such as Krillin replacing Android 17 if he's on your team for 18's ultra, or Goku's legendary scene of first going super saiyan, or even Gohan's one-handed Kamehameha against Cell. All of which can happen organically and in regular matches. 

Summary: A good solid game that you don't have to be a DBZ or fighting game fan to enjoy.",1517266590,1517266590,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,606,19,1872,0,1373,1536776317
39715805,english,"Ignore the haters. Ignore the whiners for a moment.

There are NO issues with joystick support, it's literally a setting you have to turn on. That's it. Simple as that.

Black screen story mode? Change V-sync to on. Bam. Instant fix.

Online play? Lagless unless someone is using wifi as their source of internet connection...which is bad for gaming in general and fighting games in particular. NO fighting game should ever be played with wifi.


Now that we've dealt with 99.9% of whiners, let's get down to the gameplay.

Perfection. And I'm not talking about Cell. (Though he's P.frickin' good.) I'm talking response times. Hell, the game even tells you the delay rate for online matches at the top of the screen so you can know EXACTLY how many MS the delay is. That's massive for fans of fighting games. It might not seem like much for casual or less intensive players, but for people who want to REALLY enjoy a fighting game and dig into the mechanics, frames, and combos? That's kind of nice. It's a quality of life improvement that I didn't really know I loved THAT much until I play other games that don't have it now.

Secondly, The graphics. GOD. DAMN. This game is good looking. Every single attack is torn straight out of a manga or anime frame. It's sex to the eyes and if you're a virgin, welcome to the big boy club. Get your jacket at the door because your visual cherry is about to be virtually popped. (All assuming you arn't running a potato. If you've got anything REASONABLY new (IE: Made within the last 3 years, maybe even 5) you should have no issue maxing this baby out. I'm running a GTX 970 and everything is maxed, and I'm sitting at a perfect 60 at all times. 

Third on our list? Music. It's great too. I can't find a track I don't like, though some of them are a little more...cinematic than I'd like. Some of them feel more like they'd be at home during cutscenes, but It's still a pretty massive roster of soundtracks considering there's one unique song for every character as well as one for each stage. If you're a fan of the music from the anime however, I'd suggest buying the collectors edition to get the soundtrack when it releases, as it will be adding in songs from the anime itself (Cross your fingers for Perfect Cell's theme. Doo doo doo wawa da doo ♫)

Fourth, Balance. F**k balance, this is dragon ball Z. Every single character is overpowered. Even Yamcha. Yamacha will wreck your SSGSS rear and then grin at you like he's just been playing the long game and is secretly the true god of distruction. Beerus bows to Yamcha. There's no power level nonsense in this game. Every character is created with the intention of all being tournament worthy and it shows. There's not a character here that just feels lacking or even really a joke character of any kind. It's a fresh breath when you can finally play who you WANT rather than who has the cannonically higher power level in the series. I'm looking at you, Tenkaichi series/Xenoverse.

I'm very critical of games. If you look at most of my reviews, there's very few games I give the pass to. But I can't find anything in Dragon Ball FighterZ to complain about. 

The story mode is...a fighting game story mode, but with an original story that feels like it COULD have been a side movie, much like the Revenge of Cooler / Bio Broly films.

The Arcade mode has an interesting mechanic of making the fights harder or easier depending on how well you do, so it pushes you to play better and better until you S rank all of them which admittedly can be a LITTLE daunting, as losing ANY one of your characters or being heavily damaged on two can result in lower rankings.

Local Vs works fine for what it is. And even has PRESET TOURNAMENT MODES. It's like it's BEGGING you to get off your butt and go make ACTUAL REAL LIFE FRIENDS. Like what's up with THAT?!

Practice mode allows for normal practice and a objective based game mode that allows you to learn the basics of the game and even some of the more advanced aspects. It's great to run through and doesn't feel contrived or like it's babysitting you. It's a training mode that RESPECTS you, instead of treating you like you've never held a controller in your hand before.

Oh and Did I mention there's HECKA UNLOCKABLES?!?!?!?!??!!? *NANI!?* 

Yeah, every fight earns you Zenni, every arcade mode cleared? MORE ZENNI. ZENNI FOR DAYS. DISREGARD FEMALES, AQUIRE ZENNI. It unlocks colors, lobby characters, titles, backing cards, and it's all randomized. 

""BULLCRAP"" i hear you scream, slightly peeing yourself a little. 

AHA, But here's the thing. Get a duplicate of an item you've already got? Get a Z coin for that instead! It allows you to pick an item you want. So once you've already got to the point of where you've got most of the stuff in the game, it actually gets EASIER to get those last few things you want. It's magical and makes it feel like Zenni has a worth even hours and hours in. 

This game is fantastic. It's a shining example of what a fighting game should be and it's the #1 played fighting game on steam right now, better than SFV and Tekken 7 Combined MULTIPLE times over. With 44 thousand peak players, 30-ish thousand peak per 24 hours and usually 20 thousand players online at any given time, you'll never be hurting to find a game. The lobby system makes finding matches easy, and when you run into ragequitters, you can mark them so that you don't have to fight them anymore, even in ranked! So you can avoid the heartache of that nonsense in as simple as three button presses. 

This game is a 10/10. A perfect fighting game. There could have been so many issues with this game that plagued other fighting games. Low playerbase on PC was a worry for some people, but no. It's the most played fighting game on steam, period.

39711478,english,"Very solid gameplay.  This game is very accessible for people who have never played a fighter, as well as having enough depth to keep fgc veterans interested.  I've never watched the show and have been pretty entertained by the story, but let's get into the actual mechanics.

One of the coolest things about this game is how it can introduce new players to fighting games by easing them into it.  All characters have ""auto combos,"" meaning you can sit there mashing the same button over and over and over and do some cool, flashy combos.  At this point, any experienced fighting game player is saying to themselves, ""that's stupid, I'll get bored.""  But wait, there are combos for you too!  Anyone familiar with fighting games will find more difficult, higher damage, unique combos for each of the characters.  You've been playing fighting games for two decades?  Chances are you won't have much use for most of the auto combos and will opt to use the more difficult combos that provide an extra 20-50% more damage.  It's a great way to introduce new players to the game while maintaining a competitive aspect that experienced players will enjoy.  Overall you're not going to see the fighter diversity that you do in games like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear, but the characters are different enough to stay interesting, even if they're a bit homogenized.

The game is also incredibly entertaining to watch.  Very flashy, big moves, big combos, big finishes.  The animation is top notch.  Super moves feel huge and punishing, super finishes in particular look amazing.  There's also not a ton of clutter on the screen, so the action is fairly easy to follow most of the time.  Again, this could be a plus or a minus depending on how much you enjoy other anime fighters like BlazBlue that can fill the screen with a daunting amount of clutter that can be incredibly difficult to follow for the uninitiated.

A possible negative for fgc vets is that three characters are locked to start and require completing arcade challenges for two characters and the entire story mode for the third.  I haven't completed the story yet, but it appears to be very long.  So far I'm about 3.5 hours into it and it has marked my progress at 22%, but I am doing all of the fights and listening to all of the dialogue so if you want to power through it you can do it much quicker.  Still, it's a sizeable time investment for those who would prefer to just hop into practice mode with all of the characters and start nailing down their combos for the competitive scene.  Alternatively, it does give a sense of progression for more casual players.  I personally would have preferred having access to all of the characters from the start and having some cool cosmetic unlocks for completing the story mode.

Overall, I'd say if you're at all on the fence about this game, it's an incredibly solid game and you won't be disappointed.",1517250890,1517250890,TRUE,3,0,0.554121435,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,580,29,5463,0,1676,1524504495
39711367,english,"A solidly built combination of two of my favourite things - ARC fighters and the Dragonball universe.

Graphics: A good match for the series, a little bit stuttery at points in the menus, but it looks and plays beautifully during a fight. The cel shaded anime look isn't for everyone (if Overwatch is too colourful  for you, you'll never enjoy this), but the aesthetics are true to the game, entertainingly flashy, and generally don't outstay the welcome in already chaotic fights.

Audio: SFX are on point, the VAs are amazing, and the music kicks ass. Nuff said. 

Storyline: ARC has a habit of sticking entire series into their games lately (what a surprise Xrd's story mode was to me...) but the cutscenes aren't over the top long, and you'll be spending most of your time fighting the AI. 
The plot is as you'd expect, involving a new character named Android 21, and is reasonably lengthy across multiple arcs.
I get most of my enjoyment from the characters and their interactions, rather than the storyline itself. The wonderful performance by the VAs just makes the experience more enjoyable as a whole, especially Frieza and Cell (ALL HAIL BRITANNIA)

Characters: You get a good selection of characters in the standard edition, spanning the spectrum across all the main DBZ arcs as well as one or three entrants from Super. I'm uncertain which 8 characters the DLC unlocks and frankly don't feel the need to pick it up yet - the current variety is still plenty for me.

Controls: Tight and easy to learn, with plenty of tutorial, training and practice options. For the most part the special moves are easy to perform, the mastery comes in chaining them together for super combos, learning when to block, recovery and all the small things that end up winning a fight. The 3v3 system is interesting and adds a nice tactical touch to the game, as well as giving you a small breather when each character goes down. The pace is quite fast once you hit the hard mode arcades or multiplayer, but most CPU fights will give you plenty of time to experiment and make mistakes.

Singleplayer: Multiple branching arcade modes with unlockable hard difficulty. A story mode with significantly more (entertaining) content, if not challenge, than your average Call of Duty single player campaign. Various challenges and practice modes, as well as offline matches against the CPU with scalable difficulty. 

Multiplayer: Blegh. I can occasionally get a match, but if like me you're living somewhere without a regional server: you're mostly screwed for multiplayer. Haven't yet managed to get into a single arena or ring match, casual and ranked world matches take easily 10-15 minutes to find. Good thing you're allowed to use the arcade mode during the wait.
I do have to say, however, that when I finally get into a match it goes well in terms of connection. No noticable frame drops or latency. 

In game economy: There's no premium currency here, just in game currencies. There are two types of currency, one is Zeni which you earn via fights, quests, story missions, combo challenges, and particularly the Arcade. The other are Premium Z Tokens, which you get for each duplicate item dropped. Items are dropped from loot capsules, and take the form of lobby characters, stamps (stickers), character colours and character card customisation.  There are currently no in game real money purchases, SSGSS DLC aside, and all of these cosmetic items can be earned in game. Although I suspect more DLC will be incoming at a relatively high price. Just sell the soundtrack and you got my money guys. Simple.

Overall: As a fan of both the principle draws of this game (a fun ARC fighter and a Dragonball game), 9/10 due to potential issues for multiplayer fans. However, as a newbie to this style of fighter, you may want to first pick up something like Guilty Gear or Skullgirls before spending full price on this, just to test the waters.

___________________________________________________

Now we come to the reviews:

Stories:

I'd like to play the previous story that appeared in Dragonball (1986 - 1989).
The Z Stories, have a new story that really surprised me.
The atmosphere, the stories are really amazing.

Gameplay:

It's a 2D fighter. You can do many things you just feel like doing. For example: arcades, arenas, stories, training, and so on.

Graphics:

For such a graphic you can say: ""You are really in this game, as real as it is, I have no problems, even with my bad laptop where I'm playing.
It's easy to play for any PC with a good FPS numbers.

Sounds:

The sounds are fitting, and are very wonderful to listen to. Can not say anything.

Control:

The controls that I play with a keyboard are set so well that I do not need a controller. I do not have to control complicated and it is also easy to control and not uncomplicated.
If you set the controls correctly, you can play wonderfully without any problems.

Characters:

The characters, as in DBS and in DBZ, who play are great. They are standard characters and they have good effects as power.

The inputs are all easy to do, as well as a basic combo structure that transfers to most all the characters.

I remember playing Hyper Dimension and thinking it was the greatest DBZ game ever. I remember seeing ads for Final Bout in Electronic Gaming Monthly and thinking it was so cool that a Dragon Ball GT game was coming out in English even though we were years from getting a proper localized version of that series. (Then I found out that both Final Bout was a big wad of dookie and GT wasn't much better, but that's beside the point.) 

I remember the Budokais, the Supersonic Warriors, the Legacy of Gokus (ugh), the weird Dragonball card game RPGs for SNES and NES. Hell, I even remember DRAGON POWER.

39708238,english,"-This review comes from a very casual DBZ and fighting games fan-

TLDR at bottom

THIS GAME IS DOPE
You ever think about a perfect game in your head and think it'll never happen because its to perfect? Yeah, this was that game for me. All the older DBZ games like Tenkiachi or Bodukai were good but WOO they can't lick this games toe. Firstly, the presentation OH BOY the presentation. The game looks ripped straight outta the anime. The art style is cell shaded, very similarly to the Naruto ninja storm games, and looks amazing. The particle effects look great, the impact from hits look great, the stages look great, THIS GAME LOOKS GREAT. The gameplay is very begginner friendly, but has much deeper layers under the surface for pros. It has a tag team mechanic very similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. where you fight with 3 different characters swapping them out and calling them in for assists. They added possibly the smartest mechanic in a fighting game since combos, the chase mechanic. If RT is pressed (At least on xbone controller) You will do a dash straight to your opponent and can start attacking immediantly. This seems pretty simple but OH MAN this simple addition helps keep the high paced action DBZ is known for. The attack system uses a light, medium, and heavy punch system like most fighting games, and for control stick motions, if you can do a hadoken in Street Fighter, thats all you need. Just a quarter circle motion along with the button for the attack you want to use. The last face button activates a special attack, and if paired with a quarter circle motion you can use a signature move of the charcter (like kamehameha for Goku) which can be used to extend combos. If pairing a quarter circle motion with RB (again on xbone controller) you can launch a super move that does large damage, and can be paired with your teamates supers, but uses two ki meters. The Ki meter is charged up by taking or dishing out damage, or holding X and A (xbone). By pressing Y and B (xbone) you can do a suprise attack behind your opponent which is great for catching them off gaurd. And that only scratches the surface of the combat. Aight, lets look at some negatives. The game currently has a story mode, practice mode, arcade mode, ring matches with people in your lobby, and worldwide online matches (ranked and casual). And, thats it. (Currently) its kinda lacking in content. And the online conectivity is sorta unreliable at the moment (not bad, just shoddy) but that is probably becuase the servers are getting slammed with players at the moment, since as i write this, we are still in the launch window of the game. Thats it. Two cons that'll probably be ironed out soon. The game might not be worth $60 bucks at the moment, but xenoverse 2 is also 60, and this game craps on xenoverse, so take that for what you will.

TLDR- The game looks great, plays great, but slightly lacks in content at the moment, and the servers are shoddy at the moment, although that will probably be fixed soon.

Overall, this game is great, and worth your money for sure, in the state it is in now, I wouldn't say pay $60 for it unless you're REALLY HYPED like I was, its probably worth around $35-$45 dollars with the amount of content it has now.

The 50/50, but you already knew that, and it wouldnt fit anyways:
- No flight in combat (2d fighting what did you expect?)
- No transformations at will (meaning no going from goku to goku ssb in the same battle, understandable but still.. i wouldve loved that!!)

Pros:
- Each character seems to have its own style and combos
- Great Supers and Ultras
- Story mode is not the best, but god its good to watch (anime wise)

39701205,english,"Warning, opinions ahead. Proceed knowing this.

The game is, as I believe, a success. A faithful Dragon Ball game with beautiful visuals, my goddamn new waifu, and visceral gameplay, but you'll need the reflexes of a trained martial artist in order to actually play competently. Reflexes I no longer possess. Yes, I do understand that is an excuse and implies that I - the faceless voice on the internet - do anything more than reside indoors and play games, but you try to live with a tumor in your wrist that causes digital numbness and see where that getes you in a fighting game on a casual level.

I was led to expect, as some might have been, that this game would be a touch more complex than it is. Such is to say, more involved and by chance predictable combinations of attacks. The removal of differentiated punches and kicks compared to other fighting games is unwelcome for me, on the given that it is now very difficult - to a point where it destroys the fun of the game - to detect what block will apply and where. There are the obvious telegraphed attacks, but then there are the small combo-builders that I would previously have expected to have been blocked in other games of similar genre. This may not be a problem for some, but it is a problem for me.

This goes gently hand in hand with another issue I came to notice with controlling the game. Between my original Xbox One controller and the Pro/Elite/whatever variant (the one with the extra buttons on the back if you want them and such and palm grips), the game seems to have difficulties registering D-Pad input for me. The super-special-pro-woohoo version has a better switch as far as I'm concerned for the D-Pad, but still had the saem amount of success that the Xbox One regular-lameo-wimpy-boi version. Which is to say, about 60% of the time I would not fire off my super attack unless I was spamming the hell out of it, and then sometimes it would do the wrong one because it registered it going the wrong way. Inversely, I had roughly a 70% success rate with the actual control stick paddle, even if in my throes of Dragon Ball-ing I did lose one. They're magnetic and can be interchanged, what did you expect?

Frankly, this game might be nice with a fight-stick with all those fancy controller customizations that make them good for fighting games. But that's a big ol' chunk of change right there.

Fighting games are all about reading what will happen next. My matches thus far have been nothing but waiting for the other person to be impatient enough to instigate, and be heavily punished for it. If someone has spent a grand portion of their time in recent months learning and practicing the game at their every convenience, good on them, and perhaps they have a mote of skill that will carry on to perservere through what I have not been able to.

I suppose now is as opportune too say as any: I am not calling the game bad, nor do I think it is bad. I simply do not like how it plays and frankly somewhat regret my large purchase on it, having gotten the best edition while the game now rests uninstalled from my computer to spare me from temptation of upsetting myself with my own shortcomings.

My lasting complaints forever will ride upon the matchmaking system in the game. I will pardon that it's very soon after launch, but I will not pardon that I - while on a losing streak, and having not won a game out of my matches for a good fifteen minutes (in-fight time, not lobby time), and being pitted against someone who is either smurfing (somehow) or otherwise has won all of their games (or is on an 80%+ win rate) is unacceptable. When I am trying to pit myself against some onf ""similar skill,"" I expect similar skill, not ""they haven't put all their time into the ranked mode yet, but they're exceedingly knowledgable for what their combos and links are."" Unacceptable.

The other - yeah, more bitching, I said ""complaints,"" and I have to point this out - is that the MvC style switching of characters seemed janky at best. This is a consensus generally found within my circle of fighting game friends, each of which are rather big fans of the MvC series. The quick-switch would work here and there, and the deflect-switch would as well, but there's a repeated case of ""it isn't as responsive as it should be."" I've lost one of my three more times than I care to think because my switch-out didn't trigger. Naturally I hear the cries of ""switch while on the offensive,"" but when you're in the middle of someone's infinitely chained combo because they have the reflexes of a fighter pilot, there's not much ""offensive"" going on, unless you mean offensive to your own self as some sort of self-deprecative thing.

Overall, if you understand the game, awesome, have fun. Enjoy yourself. Please, because I think the game is wonderful for what it is and I just can't get behind that. I'm far more acquainted with the Budokai and Budokai Tenkaichi games and their style of play, which I recognize is horribly flawed to begin with but was just as fun.

I'm some know-nothing on the internet, so no rating system. I hope that my gripes turn out to be just me being bad, but genuinely I think there needs to be some changes to how it functions before I'll be able to enjoy the $140+ CDN I spent on it.",1517212571,1517212571,FALSE,8,7,0.419947594,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,234,1,1785,0,1163,1522215825
39701015,english,"Most people playing this game will be familiar with the source material, and most likely grew up with and/or has seen a lot of Dragon Ball. As someone who has never seen the show, outside of clips on the internet, I can safely say that the game is still very enjoyable even if you haven't seen a single episode of Dragon Ball. The game is very careful in including expositional dialogue to help fill in the newbies to who the characters are and what their relations are, and the main plot doesn't really require a major understanding of the show to follow along, although it greatly helps. Story aside, the game itself is a lot of fun and really well made. Arc System Works, the guys behind BlazBlue, did a great job creating an awesome and entertaining fighting game, and the visuals, made to feel like an episode from the show more like a 3D interpretation, are stunning. It feels like an Arc game, although things are simplified this time around, so it's good for beginners too. I'm not too far in the story at this point, but I do want to point out that a negative is it can get a bit repetative in the main quest. A lot of fighting the same clone enemies as filler between story pivots, and it feels more like grinding for EXP than saving the world. You can skip some battles and go straight to bosses, but you'll be at a disadvantage. Not that it matters, as the AI isn't very smart. If you don't move, it won't do much, and it's easy to corner and doesn't react well. I hope it gets harder after the hero arc. 

Lastly, and a huge complaint, is how ridiculous the lobby system is. Many people will tell you it sucks, and it does. It's not well designed, and isn't very stable. I kept getting kicked out the lobbies at first, and struggled to make it to the story mode. Once you leave the lobby, the game gets much better, but it makes a terrible first impression.

I hate numbering things, but I'd give the game an 8.5/10. It's not the most intuitive fighting game I've ever played, but it's fun enough to have me hooked for now. Worth the $60.

A couple of things though
- Sometimes it's annoying to use a super attack. It wont read and I'm not sure if other people have the same problem as me.
- The story mode is decent, just a little slow throughout the beginning but it also gives you a chance to really practice those combos.

This game will be the breath of fresh air you've waited for for so long. Fantastic combat, not too technically difficult to learn like most other fighting game titles,  a few hours of practice in battle training can get you semi good with any given character that you enjoy, best tag team system I've ever seen as I'm not a huge fan of tag team, but I love DBZ so I had to give it a try and if you're like I was and on the fence about the tagging in and out bit, don't worry it is incredibly well optimized into the game with amazing synergies between your team as you perform combos even with super attacks. This is the first fighting game I personally have played in a long time that has completely swept me off my feet (Literally lol) The lobby system is okay, it could definitely be better, however there are so many different ways to fight another person nobody should really complain as you'll always find an opponent one way or another via Arena/Ring/Ranked/Casual etc. The loot box system is cool, no microtransactions yet, but I could see them implenting that eventually with the premium Hercule coins, however the loot is strictly cosmetics: Lobby Avatars/Titles/Headers/ Stamps nothing to boost you in battle or any of that nonsense. all in all its fantastic and you can clearly see the love the creators put into making it. HIGHLY recommend for any DBZ fan, if you're thinking about it, just buy it you won't regret.

I'll repurchase the game once the steam invite a friend feature is implemented.

As it stands, I cannot click on a friend and invite or join via the steam interface.

39697390,english,"Right, you're probably going to see a lot of positive reviews about this game floating around. That's because the game works for them. Great! Happy it works for you. At the time of this review I have about 4 hours of gameplay put into this. You're probably going to say ""don't say anything if you haven't played it yet!"" But I have played it. Well, at least I've tried playing it. For four hours, I have been troubleshooting this game trying to get the online to work. I have played a total of 2 Online matches. That's roughly 10 minutes of gameplay. I'm going to say it now, and depending on how the situation changes, I might change my opinion: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

I'll begin with the positives, because that's only appropriate for the effort put into making this game. it's gorgeous. Initally I thought it looked gimmicky after watching trailers and gameplay, but after playing it, it feels amazing! It plays really well and despite an easy combo system there's some levels of depth to execution. It's really really fun. And for those hardcore DBZ fans, I can't imagine this game disappointing. It's even prettier than GuiltyGear and Blazblue which are themselves absolutely beautiful. Execution feels great and you generally have a good idea of what you're doing as you're playing, and you're not hindered by lag very often. 

The story is really interesting and the characters you can play are some of the most popular loved characters so that's a real bonus. When the game works, playing with friends and strangers is fantastic. The experience is somewhat undescribable. It's easy enough that new players to fighting games are welcome in warmly. It's casual enough that it keeps you hooked to winning enough. It appears as if it's competitive in its gameplay such that there's depth to the combat system as well - though I'm definitely not at that level to start talking.

Right that's it, pros over. The cons will be addressed now, and boy are they some bad cons. Arcsys has had some serious trouble with online multiplayer in its previous games. Blazblue and GuiltyGear are riddled with issues and required me to either open my router to DMZ or use a VPN to play online. At least I could play online. I've tried everything from different regions, to VPN, to opening ports to make this game work. No dice. This game has JUST launched and already a sizeable portion of consumers are unable to play the game. A humorous thought popped into my mind last night. I remembered No Man's Sky and everyone asking where multiplayer was. That's exactly what I was asking when I was playing this game last night. Where's multiplayer Bandai Namco? Arcsys? Where is it?

There's 4 things that stand out at launch that have made this game somewhat unbearable.

1) A permanent lobby mode, where you're forced into chibi form to run around and figure out where you're going instead of using a good old menu. Why the social aspect? There's literally no reason to not use a menu. 

2) Connecting with friends. You CANNOT invite friends to any game or lobby. You need to coordinate with your friend, find the same room, in the same region, find each other in the little hub lobby they have, open a ring and pray to GOD it works. That leads on to the next point.

3) IT DOESN'T WORK. I'm super happy (seriously, not ironically) that this game works fantastically for many people. But also for many people they often find this error - ""Cannot join because room is full"" or ""No rooms found"". After trying to connect with a friend for an hour we just gave up and moved to Skullgirls because that works. When A 7 quid game outperforms a 60 quid game. I cannot express my disappointment when I could not find games. Alright, so maybe private matches don't work, how about ranked or casual matches? Surely those must work, after all that's the meat of the game!

4) IT DOES NOT WORK NICE TRY. Enjoy waiting 10 minutes for a game. I'm more than certain it's not the population that's lacking. Almost every server is filled. There MUST be at least ONE person who's matching at the same time. Turns out, it's apparent that there's no one! Sorry! Enjoy the single player fighting game!

I'm probably not going to bother playing this game until a patch comes out. I'll be able to provide a significantly more in depth review once I get to play >2 matches. As it stands, it is completely unplayable. I can't connect with my friend, who was the sole reason I bothered to buy the game at all. At this point, it seriously feels like you should just NOT buy the game and wait for a patch and/or buy it on sale. The worst part is, having tried EVERYTHING, I can't tell if it's the game's problem or my problem. Every other fighting game works online for me. Tekken, GuiltyGear, Street Fighter. You name it, it WORKS. it doesn't work for this game though. What's the problem Arcsys, Bandai? Please illuminate me.

39645300,english,"I am not a very big fan of fighter games, but I do enjoy them every now and then. This game seems like a great fighter game that is easy to access, and has enough enough complexity behind it to keep you engaged. There are things like auto combos where you mash a button, but the real damage and flash is hidden behind combos that require practice and timing.

As for the Dragon Ball aspect to the game it is very nice to see the characters have amazing animations, voice work, and the game itself really does justice to the material. The characters portray their material counterparts very well, and the moves you know and love are here and ready for your use.

The game does have some bugs, but they aren't very important besides being annoying. The game will show you xbox prompts even when using a keyboard is an example. At least the combo challenge has an annoying ""bug"" where if you complete a challenge you aren't allowed to use the ""reset challenge"" button until you reselect the challenge you are already on. It could use some quality of life fixes is the main point here.

The online lobbies seem to be much better than the terrible mess that it was on launch. Back at launch I couldn't even get online due to the way it was setup. Now it seems to log me into a lobby as soon as I boot up the game without having to spam the option to join.

Overall I am enjoying the game even with the frustration of trying to perfect combo timing and train my hands to perform on a keyboard (the steam controller proved difficult to get any kind of consistency). I think this is a great game for fans of Dragon Ball that are willing to put in the work to get good at fighting games.

If you plan on getting through the game with just the simpler auto combos, then you would probably be better off waiting for a sale.

39697124,english,"[b] I am posting this almost immediately after beating the last arc of the story mode [/b]
[h1] Pros [/h1]
I reccomend this game to both fighting game fans and dragon ball fans. 
For fighting game fans this is a good game to learn combos on your own, with the fighting as a team of 3 mechanic can lead to many different, interesting combos.
For Dragon Ball fans the story mode is very entertaining because of the variety of interactions that the characters have, although there is not a large array of characters, compared to games like Xenoverse 2.
The art style is gorgeous and very true to how the characters are portrayed in the anime.
[h1] Cons [/h1]
My main complain thus far is the gameplay of the story mode.
The story mode is divided into 3 different segments, and 2 of the three are tolerable, where you can grind levels if you feel like it. Although in the thrid segment, you a limited to two characters and forced to grind throughout 2/3 of the segment, which was aggravating to say the least.
The cutscene animation is also mediocre, but understandably so since this is a 2.5D fighting game, not a cinematic adventure.

39697009,english,"Really great game if you like the series.  I'm not a hardcore fighting game player so I cant really say how it stacks up to others but as far as im concerned its really fun.  It reminds me of the old SNES DBZ fighting games like Hyper Dimensions only WAY modernized.  The combos and the look of the game is really cool, almost like your watching an episode.
The bad in this game is pretty aweful in my opinion.  The cut scenes while looking like an episode of the show are visually pleasing, the need to hit a button to progress the cutscene after every sentence is just totally immersion breaking.  I would like to just sit back and watch the entire cut scene unfold rather than hit A after every line.  Otherwise you leave the characters in limbo waiting for you.

39641416,english,"i bought the 110€ (Ultimate Edition) and i do absolutely not regret anything. It's a great deal. You get a decent amount of strong characters, some stamps (used as icons in game for chat) some lobby characters (The charcters at this time i write this isnt out yet.) and some few other stuff. For me i absolutely love the game and have already played over 5 hours (was at the time i wrote this) of the game. 

I really do recommend the game since the playstyle is really unique in the style of figthing games. 

The game have absolutely lovely graphics, texture, shader and the abilities just looks really amazing. For a newly released game (i know beta and such has been there) it is actually a pretty well done job. 

I know it isn't at its top of the peek and can probably 
be done a little more with (like new characters such as broly or others). As said i do recommend this game tho i wouldn't recommend it for people who doesn't have a strong computer. If you can take playing laggy then go ahead and enjoy i would recommend being able to play the game smoothly since a lot of things is happening in a fast pace so keeping up is important in this game. 

You are able to switch from japanese voices to english if thats what you wish for which is a nice touch to it all so you can use the japanese voices if its for your liking. I do like the english voices more myself.

I wouldn't say the game is perfect but i would give it a solid 8/10. 

They create their own story nicely and have their own touch of things towards the game. The CPU you are fighting when going local could be a bit more balanced tho its fine really. Being able to turn the difficulty on the CPU in a scale is pretty cool. (the scale goes from 1 - 100) 

Before buying the game watch YT'ers and really reconsider if it is a game for you. Would be sad to use 60€ on a game you won't be playing too much. But again i recommend the game.

If you have read some other comments then you should know. The 8 DLC characters aren't out yet tho will be added. From that you also get and i quote ""those new fighters also come with their respective stamp, set of alternative colors and Lobby Avatars."" if you still don't get that part. It basically means you get those 8 characters playable AND as lobby avatars and ALTERNATIVE COLORS: Not to mention (maybe more then one) their stamp. If you are looking through the DLC's without having the game and thinking ""What is a stamp used for?"" well their used for in game chat as PICTURES that you can have fun with. You can also set a presetted message made by the game to a stamp for your choosing. If you ask me this is highly worth it for the main reason its 8 new characters, 8 new lobby avatars for a respective price, alt colors plus some stamps. Also the other DLC's is worth it if you ask me tho thats my opinion.

The other DLC's says themselves and explain on their own of what they give. Their will be more DLC's the game is new and i do hope there will be more. (at the time i am writing this that is)

One more thing before i end it. I know it is long so bare with me here. The game is HIGHLY based on skill and not characters. If you are really good you can make a a character like yamcha look like goku is nothing but an ant. So if you are a player that likes highly skill based games this is a game for you. Tho it is unique and very easy to grasp the controls of the game.

Also if you buy the game i recommend playing the practice mode before anything. Take your time there since it can actually help.

Hope this was helpful and if you bought the game have fun!",1517011963,1517181083,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,141,29,10482,292,1868,1602006880

It is very accessible and I've been having a great time playing the story mode which was surprisingly good.

HOWEVER. As Im sure you've seen in the other reviews, online is currently flawed(?) I don't know how else to describe it.
As of the righting of this there are 4 servers in western canada and 4 in eastern each with a cap of 64 people...

So as much as I want to try the online mode and get my ass handed to my by someone who actually knows how to play, I cannot. So until the other 2/3 of this game unlocks I'm gonna have to go with a negative review.

I am aware Im writing this day 1 but did they really not expect more people? They had beta tests for these exact reasons.

tl;dr Game is real fun but good luck getting into an online lobby.

This may be the best fighting game you can buy on Steam right now, whether you be a newcomer to the FGC or a hardened veteran from games like Blazblue and Guilty Gear.

PROS:
-Easy to learn mechanics for those new to the genre
-Autocombos sacrifice damage for convenience, letting the player decide their playstyle
-The art is simply to die for, I mean look at this! A fighting game hasnt looked this good since Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator!
-An all star cast of characters from both Super and Z, with a few exceptions (I need me my movie characters and Gogeta!)
-THE SOUNDTRACK MAKES MY EARS NUT
-3v3 fighting a la Marvel and Skullgirls, with convenient ways to swap on the fly and neat assists.
-OH MY GOD THESE SPECIAL MOVES LOOK FRIGGIN AMAZING
-There are so many little easter eggs with the Dramatic Finishes (Yamcha's Revenge, the Trunks and Frieza scene)
-Lively community (as of writing this on 1/28/18) willing to teach and spar.

CONS
-Yeahhhhhh the online matchmaking kinda sucks
-Xenoverse noobs get salty, which won't be a problem in a few months
-Why do we have to join a massive online lobby to even play single player content? Menus work too you know.

Price Value: Amazing. I go off of a $2 per hour scale, and with 3 days on and already 21.2 hours as of writing this, I can see that this game will well exceed its value (even with the season pass added on!)

[h1] FINAL VERDICT:  9/10	[/h1]
This game has provided some of the most fun out of the Dragon Ball franchise I haven't experienced since the 3rd Budokai game.

39691138,english,"An excellent, but different kind of fighter.

The good: Amazing graphics, you will feel like you're in control of your favorite dbz character. Large roster feautring pretty much every character you would want to play (and some you don't). 

What sets DBZ apart is the frenetic pace of the combat along with the reduction in difficulty. Unlike other fighters (SF, GG) once you get ""caught"" in a combo, it's almost impossible to defend or escape. Since every character has single button strings, combos are incredibly easy to execute, so this tilts everything toward hyper agression. The Dragon Rush ability allows you to stick to your opponent so infinite loops are possible for some characters. This can make the game incredibly frustrating if you button spam. 

The balance between characters is decent (even Yamcha is viable (but you still won't use him)), but expect to see Black Goku and SSGSSs in almost every online match. If you're looking for Street Fighter in a DBZ skin, this isn't it. You won't get footsies or have high low strings to break guards. What you will get is a nuanced fighter with your favorite dbz characters.

The game runs much better than I think even the devs realize (my specs are below minimum requirements but I get 60fps on max settings with a 670mx). Every character feels unique and every input feels smooth. The story starts out REALLY stupid but eventually gets the wheels rolling and starts feeling like a real DB arc, but without filler. The voice actors gave it their all as well, especially the new VA for Freeza, and 21's VA being in a new role. Everyone gets really in to their characters and it shows.
The controls are friendly for all types of players. Combo setups can be simple and executed decently easily, but there are still mixups that require more skill.
The combat feels great. Every input feels right, the sounds are all clear and match up perfectly, and pretty much all the moves are taken straight out of the anime. Clashing against an opponent who is hitting the same buttons as you is just awesome.

Some people say their stick isn't working, but I guess it depends on the stick compatability. Mine is a Qanba Q1 so it works great no matter the game.

(+)PROS:

-Runs great
-mechanically solid, in depth fighting system that is easy to learn, hard to master
-Captures the fast-paced nature of DBZ well
-Lots of nods to lore
-Great online multiplayer
-Good sound/music. Can change between Japanese/American voices on the fly. 
-Balanced

(-)CONS:

-Not enough servers on launch night (mostly smoothed out now) 
-Honestly struggling to find things to list here


This game is really good....especially so if you are a DBZ fan.

The action is fast and furious, and runs as smooth as butter with no frame loss. The control scheme is simple enough for new players to pick up and play with, but deep enough for competitive players to really enjoy. Easy to play, hard to master.

They paid a lot of attention to the details, too. There are lots of cool chracter-specific interactions and one-liners that happen even in the middle of a fight that fans will really enjoy.

Characters all seem balanced so far, with no clear ""must picks"". It's really cool to be able to finally pick some of your favorite characters from the DBZ franchise, and have them be viable. Yamcha is totally on par with Goku Blue. It may sound off to fans of the lore, but they pull it off REALLY well. The 3-person team mechanic is also a lot of fun, with assists and swap outs similar to the Marvel vs Capcom series.

The multiplayer lobby set up is pretty neat, and handles a lot smoother than past iterations, like Xenoverse 2. It's not as large or complex, and I think that is what makes it work better. You can get into games VERY quickly, and have your choice of a lot of different options -There are different types of ring battles, which include you teaming up with 2 other players to fight another player team of 3, there are Arena battles which are kind of like a bear pit scenario, where a bunch of players are all in one place just fighting one opponent after another, and there is your standard ranked and casual play. 

The one downside of the multiplayer I feel I must note, is that on launch day, there were not enough servers. Even though there were a TON (that you can actually see in-game) they were all still filling up really fast. I give them some slack on that though....no one expected the game to be as big as it is, and I'm sure it will get cleared up. Even on day 1 I could get into lobbies within minutes, and since then it hasn't been an issue.

Single player options include a story mode that has a decent enough story and cutscenes, as well as a traditional arcade mode that sees you battling up a ladder. You can also play local multiplayer with a friend - I have tested this out a few times personally, and it runs as smooth as the rest of the game.

I highly recommend this game to any fighting game fans, or fans of DBZ.

39685651,english,"Honestly, this is a wonderful game. Right now, I can not give it a thumbs down at all. I am still playing through the story and I must say I am quite impressed. So visually, this game steps up a little from Guilty Gear Xrd. Visually stunning. The sounds sound exactly like the show and the animations. Astounding. The combos are a little more simplified from Guilty Gear however, it still feels like the depth is there especially because of the tag in and tag out system with your allies. It is fun to find combos and try and replicate them with the best of  my trash abilities. I was honestly scared of the auto-combo system, but I'm glad to know that I was worrying for no reason. They translate well into this game and there are pros and cons of using the.

Characters are generally varied with some exceptions. There are characters that feel different and require a bit of different gameplay. Your teams is kind of like a mix match game of who do you want together depending on how they feel to you. They need to fit your style of play, and I find that fun.

Sadly, I have not gone into multiplayer yet. I have actually been too intrigued into the story (which was very surprising). I will be soon though, so I will be able to verify if Arcsys fixed the whole matchmaking system. The game has been getting quite a few updates (according to steamDB), so I am hoping it works.

!General score at bottom of review! Skip to the end if you dont want.. information?

[h1] Gameplay 8/10 [/h1]
Existing out of:

[b] Combat 5/5 [/b]
Combat feels very well done. While the movelist is limited, its the interaction, timing and using the other 2 characters makes it so there is a clear difference between people that like to try and spam basic combo's and block... and people who have the experience to know what they are doing (Spoiler.. meaning, not me)
It is not to difficult to come into and is decently noob-friendly but the mastering part can take up a while to say the least.
Unlike some other fighting games i did not like, this game at least does not have ""well, this person played way to much and even though i am full health, because he hit me once.. i will be stunlocked 24/7 from now on and lose"" ... there are alot more ways to avoid/get out of combo's which imo is a bit more fair.
Even though i am bad at the game, i still really enjoy it.

[b] Matchmaking 3/5 [/b]
As with any game starting off, the matchmaking is not to amazing.
However as said ... matchmaking is a thing that requires playerdata to improve, meaning there is 0 chance of matchmaking working well at release of any game.
Still need to give a point so gonna give it a ""fine"" because it hasnt been that bad.

[h1] Story 7/10 [/h1]
Story is decent. Some of the cutscenes are quite funny. Storymode itself is.. well.. it is what it is, not great, not bad either. It has fights, a gridbased system that makes you choose between becoming stronger by doing more fights/gathering more buffs (but also find more annoying enemies) or going through the story faster. Its fights.. and cutscenes ;D
Still decent enough for a fighting game.

[h1] Characters 7.5/10 [/h1]
Existing out of:

[b] Differences 4/5 [/b]
Roster is not to bad. A decent amount of characters to pick but most important.. do they feel different? Yes. Yes they do.
And thats what i am giving this game points for, for making characters that dont all feel like youre throwing out the same punches. All characters seem to have their prefered combo's, prefered gameplay and prefered teamcombinations.

[b] Character/Profile customisation 3.5/5 [/b]
Well. A few character cloth colors. Decent amount of lobby characters with colors/effects and enough profile card customisation.
As long as they dont add flashy unnessecary cosmetics into the fight itself, it works.

[h1]Technical aspects [/h1]
Not gonna grade this as this envelops way to many different configurations, setup and knowledge-differences per person.
Yes, there are error messages. Yes, those can be solved.
Can developers expect people to fix their own stuff? Yes and no. Yes as in.. they should. No as in ... people prefer to refund before trying nowadays. Players seem to think that PC's are like consoles as in, no technical knowledge required. Paying for stuff seems  to leave a bigger entitlement imprint than it sued to for sure.

Hereby my list of things i went through to get rid of all error messages for myself (havent had one since)
- Clean install of latest GPU update
- Exception of the Dragon Ball FighterZ folder in all anti-virus
- Use of controller on wire instead of through bluetooth (game had problems with the bluetooth driver)
- Running the game through big picture and on full-screen mode]
- Some people have also said there should be an U4Engine exe for requirementinstallations that you can run again to make sure all software is correctly installed

Can it solve disconnect errors? Not really nope. Can't say ive seen any disconnect messages in UK and Germany regions but i might be lucky and/or it might happen in other regions.

39684278,english,"Honestly, one of the best fighting games I've played in quite some time. If you are coming into this expecting it to be like Mortal Kombat or Injustice 2, you'll be wrong. It has a more Marvel vs. Capcom 2 feel to it.

FighterZ is extremely easy to get into. The tutorials tell you how to do basic combos which still make you look badass while doing it. It's combat is beautiful, fluid, and is quite snazzy looking when you're able to combo a character chain right into an ultimate.

The story is an original story, not a rehash of you going through all the arcs through Dragonball Z and Super. They've even gone so far as to add a new character named Android 21 who is a Majiin android. Her creation was supervised by Akira Toriyama himself. She has quite a unique playstyle and is a great addition

My only gripe with the game is the Arcade. I hate artificial difficulty in games, and the arcade is a pretty good example of such. Hard modes of the arcade instead boost up the NPC difficulty rather than have them do some amazing combos. If one character is able to do one basic heavy combo, you lose half your health.

The lobby system is qutie annoying as well. It's hard to get into the same lobby with your friends to play against them, since you have to be in the same lobby to play with them. I wish they would add just a normal private match system so you are able to invite your friends rather than deal with the hassle of getting into the limited lobbys with only 64 player max slots. Quite annoying

All in all, this is definitely a pickup. If you love fighting games and love Dragonball, this is well worth the $60 pricetag.

the gameplay is very fast paced 2D fighting with graphics that are absolutely amazing.
the specials are great and make nods to the source material in ways i did not expect to see in todays age of gaming where developers take the safe route with the bare minimum.
this game goes above and beyond and the people that know the shows will be rewarded for that.

though there are some lip sync errors when you set the language to anything but japanese.
especially goku black when you get the intro scene is having more talking animation for 3 seconds after his line is done.
a very minimal complaint, maybe even nitpicky.

39651248,english,"Having seen a lot of issues relating to controllers and arcade sticks, I can say that I have my PS4 controller using no 3rd party software working just fine. 
Also my custom hitbox controller working with no changes required, though I am unable to rebind my hitbox inside the game, but have found the default layout to work just fine.
I am aware that this info is most likely useless as everyone elses setups are different but for what it's worth its fine for me.

The online net code seems to be doing the job in all the online games I have only had 2 stutters. That was against someone with a 2bar connection so I will just stick to 3 bars+. Can't help the existence of WiFi warriors or just dodgy internet!

The game looks stunning and feels super responsive which is a must in a fighting game. The screen can become cluttered which is something I hope I get used to, this coming from someone who prefers the less flashy tekken so maybe I just suck with my shit eyes.

The combo system seems to be an area of contention for a lot of people. The way I see it is that the auto combos exist to bridge the gap for newbies so that they get a reward for landing a successful hit. While the people that spend time learning proper combos and pressure strings are rewarded with more damage, better hit confirming, better pressure, building more meter etc.

If your game plan involves spamming Super Dash and mashing punch that will not get you that far. As it should be, every fighting game has its ""cheap tactic"", spamming shoryuken in street fighter, snake edges in tekken and punching in the nuts in real life. It is not to say that a cheap tactic isn't somewhat effective in early levels of play but that a solid strategy exists to almost completely nullify it (Down + heavy when you see your opponent do a super dash, free combo but it is hard to react to!). Those that seek a solution improve those that don't....don't.

Now I want to be clear that I am not claiming everything is balanced, or that no really strong ""cheap tactic"" exists. 
I haven't played nearly enough of the game to make that kind of call, in fact even after hundreds of hours I still probably couldn't. Just that the game is new, stuff is being discovered and as usual with fighting games a bit of research and practise will go a long way in helping you improve. 

All in all, what is reading like some kind of rant hides how much I am enjoying this game, it is fun, well polished for the most part. Limited online lobby space is dumb, they need to sort that out! Offline lobbies exist for playing solo but still it can be a pain when you want to online, though I may be missing something here. 

Why the need for this walk around lobby, what is wrong with menus!

Lots of content, not even touched story yet, solid practise mode, solid arcade, online ranked and unranked.

39678600,english,"Great game with interesting mechanics, but for £45 I was left wanting way more, the lack of characters seems odd, having characters like nappa but not Zarbon or Dodoria is criminal, I get that more characters will be coming soon but these most likely will not be free, Jiren and UI Goku will probably burn a fat hole in your wallet when you buy the DLC. It is good dont get me wrong, in fact I would go as far to say that it feels better then the xenoverse series in terms of combat, but for £45 this game isnt all there. The game has a story mode, a very lacking one but its there, it features mainly choppy animated cutscenes with some great lines between characters, these are great but not nearly great enough to make up for the stories emptyness. Fighting one new character aswell as 2 we have fought for years gets very boring very quickly, my favorite part of the story was the ability to play from both sides, both good and evil, this took me back to the lego batman days, if you know what I mean.

+Very accessible to new players, combos start from button mashing X to complicated timed aerial combos

+Combine the two pros above with the game oozing with DBZ references and animation thats even better than the anime and the game is an absolute joy to play!



Cons
-Game would randomly (but rarely) get disconnected from the lobby sometimes

-lobby system with chibi characters is a bit off from the actual fighting gameplay. Just the menus would have sufficed.

Dragon Ball FighterZ will go down as one of the best fighting games of this generation, and one well worth the asking price. Capcom and Street Fighter V needs to take notes from ArcSys and Namco!

this game is really fun to play

Bottom line- if you're a casual fighting gamer that loves dragon ball then i say this a great purchase. 

first off i'm not a hardcore fighting gamer. i've dabbled in old school tekken, soul calibur, the new mortal combat, and the newer dead or alive. out of those games only soul calibur (on gamecube) and tekken( on ps2) really kept me wanting to play and get better, the other ones i lost interest pretty quick. i was skeptical about this game at first considering i'm not big into fighting games. but the more i saw the more i wanted to play it, and that to me is a good sign. after 14.5 hours of playing this im still wanting to play more. i really love this game, it may be due nostalgia but who cares? if i have fun playing the game then that's all that matters. this game does seem to be more for casual fighting gamers like myself, so hardcore fighting gamers might not like it as much. yes currently the online isn't the best, the lobbies are always full and i've lost connection to several matches, but wanna know a secret? there are offline modes to play!!!! the story mode is actually pretty easy but i still enjoy it and i like the story. if you want more of a challenge the arcade mode is crazy on hard mode. so please quit giving this game a bad review because of the servers. that is something that can be fixed with updates.",1517125096,1517125096,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,100,27,3421,0,2026,1548024258

Risk is not here thankfully!

I've haven't played online yet, but this game is intuitive, colourful (I love cell shading graphics), follows and feels like Dragon Ball and the fighting style is very, very easy and simple to pick up. Yes there are a few technical skills to pickup, but the regular story mode hands them to you in a simple manner. 

Fun, good on low system specs, and runs fluidly. Also, it's 4.2 GB to dowload! For me, this generation, that's a miracle. 

Unlocking characters by playing the game is common sense to me...it has an interactive menu, where you log onto the server. I got on first go. Got on second and third go too. I've played as the first 3 characters I could find, Goku, Krillin and Buu...each looks unique and is fun to play (especially Buu). 

Never played a figher before and wondering if this is hard? Don't. It's not Street Fighter. Very, very simple game to pickup. Very easy to defend yourself. Clearly has a high level of mastery available but is fun and quick to get into. 

Definitely worth buying IMO. Good value and a great feel. I feel rewarded just playing the single player...so yeah, it's like an interactive sequence of Dragon Ball Super episodes.

DBFZ is a fantastic game. It's easy to pick up but difficult to master, so there's a little something for everyone regardless of your skill level. The game feels like a combination of MvC2, Guilty Gear, and Skullgirls- super sick imho. I highly recommend giving the game a try!

39672851,english,"DBFZ is simultaneously friendly and accessible to inexperienced players as well as full of complexity and depth for fighting game veterans. 

The controls are very simple, so don't worry if you are not good at directional motion inputs. But at the same time, the mechanics and simple fact that it is a 3v3 fighter make the skill ceiling very high, so there is unlimited potential for mastery.

The fighting itself is streamlined and fun. Don't be discouraged by the 'auto combos', they do not compare at all to the potential damage of manual combos, so they are not optimal. And yet, they actually have a ton of nuance and complexity built in, because you can use them partially during manual combos to lengthen and extend the combo itself in different ways. It's really interesting.

The visuals are completely unmatched for this style, and that really does enhance the overall experience.

Online play is very good, despite some early server issues which can be expected with any popular game during its release.

There is a ton of single player content, which is great for 'casual' players, but also functions as an entertaining way to just practice new characters even for experienced players. I've nearly finished the story and have been pleasantly surprised by really enjoying playing characters I never would have tried otherwise.

DBFZ is a blast for Dragon Ball fans and FGC players alike. It would be difficult to not find something to love about this game.

I hate the fact that you literally have to wait for like 1-5 minutes to have someone to fight during Ranked / Casual Matches, and when you do. Theres always like 1 or 2 Bar so there is like a 5MS DELAY. 

Then if you do fight someone, sometimes the game would just disconnect you to the lobby, because WHY THE HELL NOT. So if you get disconnected to the lobby. You get disconnected to the Match that you're currently playing. And that counts as a loss. Namco, this is like one of your biggest budget game you said? Maybe, atleast put in better servers and put in a better matchmaking system.

Also, Fix Arena Match, Goddamm, I hate having to wait for like the only person available to fight even when there is like 10 people queued up in the Arena.

TLDR; Don't ruin this great game because your cheap asses, get better servers, fix the goddamn Matchmaking, Namco.

Pros:
-Fantastic Story, not just another take on playing through the classic story of Dragonball. 
-Great PC port, runs smooth as hell; no fps drops
-Visuals are perfection, immerses you in the world of Dragonball
-Soundtrack is hype
-Controls are very responsive.
-Good character selection and not a set of OP characters.
-Voice acting is on point and character interactions will ma-ma-make your heart happy.

Cons:
-Servers are rough at times.
-Occasional long-match making.
-No true in-game chat, makes it difficult to matchmake with friends without Discord, etc.
-Gamepad only shows in Xbox not PS4 controls.

The only problem I honestly have is the limited roster. The Dragonball universe is filled with great characters, and it's a tragedy that many big name stars will not be in this. The quality of the game excels far beyond previous DBZ games, and that no doubt factors into the limited roster. 

60$ is a joke for many titles, most titles at that price point fail to earn it. I'd honestly say the same for this one. While the game is amazing, the content decent and what not, I'd just have to put it in the 40$ range.

I won't be purchasing the season pass, because 8 additional characters will go on sale eventually and it's no skin off my back till they do. The immediate lack of a big roster is what makes this appealing, but almost feels forced. I don't think it was the right call by the dev, because you open up the game with a fully unlocked roster aside from about 4 fighters, two of which are transformations of fighters in the game already. This is a kiddie pool sized game coming in at less than 5gig...couldn't they have forgone some of the mundane story cutscenes for a few extra fighters? 

Overall I give it a 8/10. Great game, tons of fun. However, I played/saw most everything there is to offer in just a wee 4 hours. (Story aside, but do any anime games ever have a really good story anyway? I might as well beat my head off a brick wall and hallucinate up a better story.)

This game is great and if you are a DBZ fan you owe it to yourself to play this game. The roster is great with room for improvement thanks to DLC, the music is great, the english voice acting matches up with the character lips like a greasy chinese to western movie like kung pow enter the fist.

I'm digressing. I enjoy almost every aspect about the game. The only thing I don't really like is how some of the lobby is set up. I was trying to play with a buddy I knew from highschool and setting up thee match was a pain in the ass. That is until I figured out how to switch lobbies. A bit of a nooby mistake on our ends, but I'm used to text based menus, and while there is one in DBFZ it's not as straight forward as some of the older entries. UMvC3 did that pretty well I thought. I would like to be able to challenge friends to a match through steam (tab+shift) as well. Not a needed feature but could be a cool one. 

I hear arcade joystick support is rekt on PC. I don't use one so it doesn't matter to me, and either do my friends. This does matter for those who bought one before the release. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the game not detecting xinput from the device or whether the device was made for dinput where DBFZ may possibly use xinput only. Speculation but It's easily fixable so if you can be patient don't worry too much about it. It will come.

Conclusion: Recommended to anybody who loves dragonball. I'm excited for the new characters that are going to come. I would buy the pass, but I don't want to pay for characters I may not even like. So when the time comes I'll throw more of my sheckles at this glorious fucking game <3

+ Graphics and art are outstanding. Constant 60 Fps, true to the anime and clean, readable animations and hud.

+ Gameplay is simple enough that anyone can pick up and play but with the depth you'd expect from any good 2D fighter. 

+ Works great with RAP4, I assume any stick can be configured with Steam controller support.

- Overworld lobby system feels somewhat uneccesary but a nice touch. 

- Xbox only button promts could be confusing for some

Ok so this game has brought up my DBZ nostolgia real hard and I am enjoying every last minute of it Improving my combos and just feels amazing. The roster is good in my opinion and it feels completly fine to master at least one character you feel like it suits your playstyle and it will work. Although it feels like there is a good amount of characters it just feels like majority of them are missing (DLC). But overall I enjoy it.

Ok now for the Negatives:
Lobby System: Ok this is sorta mix. Its not BAD and its not Good either concerning we're all chibi characters walking around and I am guessing its for us to interact with each other WHICH I am Completly Fine with. BUT whenever you exit out an instance from the training area or story, You would have to go back to the server selection and find another server. Right now currently in the second day, Rooms are full and there are still a very good amount of slots open which is good.

Matchmaking: Ok so I am pretty sure this is going to get resolved BUT they need to fix this whole matchmaking that takes like 5 min to find  a normal match. Of course there are alot of people in lobbies that could instantly fight with each other which is fine. 
While in considerations these aren't realy big issues in my opinion but I am pretty sure (hopefully) they get resolved.

Overall I give it a 9/10 for a DBZ fighting game. This game can be good for non-experienced people who have never played a single fighting game in their life and would still be doing good. Veterans can improve on combos and fighting the perfect team. Other than that I say its worth it but if you still feel skeptical of buying full price you can just wait until the next sale.

39669734,english,"This is after 17 hours in game, compleating the mainline story quest's all three arcs, of which I livestreamed and put up on youtube... feel free to view my channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ELPMCFlashFrame/videos

As for my take: I haven't taken a fighter this seriously since Super Street Fighter 2 back on Genesis... as far as a fighting game goes, it's accessable to new players, and has depth for people who love to deep dive into fighting game systems.

However, there ARE some problems currently... one of the main one's being Android 16's self destruct super, which will destroy an ENTIRE lifebar of a character... now it's easy to avoid, but if you get caught in it, I have a feeling people are going to bee seeing this as a huge problem [please note, I am NOT sure how much damage this move does in PVP, but in the story mode, it wrecks basically everything.]

So let me start by naming the negatives of the game:
Small roster of female characters... 2 exist, Android 21, and Android 18, that's it, if you're looking for waifu's, go play Skullgirls... because there's only two here [that being said, they are two good characters.]
Android 16's self destruct move for the reasons stated above.

Now for the positives:
Great optimization. 4k on a gtx 970 with everything set to MAX, the game looks AMAZING and at a butter smooth 60fps locked. [i've heard reports of it running just as well on a gtx 660 even]

Decent roster, compaired to something like, say, Xenoverse 2... or Tenkichi, the roster is SMALL, HOWEVER, that's nto really a bad thing when you consider this game is balanced as a fighting game first... each character feels unique, and has plenty of moves in their toolbox to get the job done.

great music, even better than Xenoverse 2 IMO, get's you pumped for every fight.

The game has Dinput support, so running with a gamepad, or a fightstick is easy as it comes, and full rebindable keys makes it easy to set the game up to play exactly how you want it to.

as of right now, I'd rate it 8/10, a solid, accessable fighting game, with a wonderful art style and tight controls.

It also boasts a complete tutorial and combo challenges for ALL of the characters with the Play Demo option. The game doesn't feel unbalanced at all and it's fairly fast paced if you find people who know what they're doing, although not as fast as UMvC3.
Characters are really diverse (with the only ""clones"" being Goku & Vegeta with their upgraded Super Saiyan Blue forms, which also varies in some regards but not much) and play really different from one another and allow for a variety of team composition.

39649949,english,"I will do my honest review of this game, as close as I can be to a neutral opinion of DB FighterZ (no spoilers so don´t worry):

PROS:

-AMAZING gameplay and BREATHTAKING graphics, Arc System did an amazing job with this game.
-Very Smooth gameplay on PC.
-Fluid combos, easy to play but hard to master.
-Is VERY fun to play with friends.
-It have arcade mode, local matches, story mode, tournament, online with ranked and player matches... companies like Crapcom could learn a lot about how to make a complete game in 2018 with basic modes.
-The BEST DB related game available since DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 in 2007.
-It looks very optimized on PC (I have a high end PC so don´t know about the performance in general on other machines)
-Great Story mode (probably the best story mode in a decade, thanks God no more ""Raditz arrival"" story)
-Roasts everywhere on story mode, way better than DB Super´s story.
-Great final boss and at last an original character.
-100% Controller compatible
-Is Dragon Ball on PC, and for the first time in a decade, a competitive fighting DB game, which I am very glad.
-So far, the online and the servers are working fine
-The avatars and customization unlockables are great
-The equivalent of loot crates (capsules) are free (well you use in game currency, but not real money) and you don´t need to grind for it, zennie, pretty much comes from everything.
-Music, in general, is pretty decent.
-It have subtittles on several languajes and the japanese / english voices are pretty good.

CONS:

-Super expensive game and there is no localization of prices. (it will short the life span of the game)
-Day one DLC
-Laughable preorder incentive, as you can unlock SSJ Blue Goku and Vegeta in game.
-Be ready to pay $30 USD for classic music tracks that can be played for free on an Xbox for example.
-Expensive Season Pass with only 8 (unknown) characters (that can potentially end up being ""Raditz"" and ""SSJ2 Goku"" instead of characters people actually want). Do you want all characters? be ready to pay $100 USD
-The game has DENUVO, which is a ""no buy"" factor in many scenarios, be aware th egame needs perpetual internet connection to work, otherwise you are locked out of your legit purchased copy of the game. Also DENUVO games can´t be modded, so forget the idea of downloading workshop mods or cool custom skins.
-BAMCO has no communication with it´s consumers and were banning or deleting posts from users on FB or their boards all night about the PC release.
-PC specs were unknown for a long time, and then were set to a very high standard, scaring potential buyers of the game.
-No Beta on PC because we are second fiddle consumers it seems... except when it comes to pay full price.
-No midnight release of the game, or even pre-load, because again, PC consumers doesn´t matter and apparently PS4 and Xbox One can download at midnight but PC in 2018, can´t.
-Apparently the game is locked on India for no reason... but they do sell DLC. LMAO
-Characters has no alt costumes, only colors.
-Autocombos are a CANCER that will kill the game, but nobody cared to take them away at least on ranked.
-No spanish or LATAM dub. This is shameful taking in consideration the price and how they actually did it for g ames like Saint Seiya Soldier´s Soul or Naruto.
-Servers are ok, but sometimes the connection is laggy even with Blue Bar-connection foes.
-An error make almost everyone unable to join matches on lobbies... which is killing the fun right now, and knowing BAMCO this error will be permanent, so be ready to play offline or arcade for good.
-The roster is too small and pathetic for a 3 vs 3 game. Remember Marvel vs Crapcom 3 in 2011 was made with way more characetrs and was also developed from zero, for 2 very different platforms, for $60 USD.
-Not all characters are very fleshed out, there are few characters that are VERY generic like Ultimate Gohan or Fat Buu, so remember, a small roster is not always equal to high quality.
-I want to kick whoever believed making us sign a Privacy Agreement with unskippable text was a good or reasonable idea. (I needed like 3 minutes scrolling down till I was able to Agree to it.)

FINAL SCORE:

9/10

Why? I gave it a high score (and a positive review even if I was tempted to give it a negative one) because the game is pretty good, it looks great and feels great to play, and is actually fun to play with other people, characters are very fleshed out in general (with few exceptions), and the original story mode is something I am grateful for it, even despise the pathetic small roster, the despicable attitude of BAMCO, the price, the plague of DLC, among other factors. 

if you are a fan of DB I advise to buy it now and support Arc System, you won´t regret it if you are a true fan of t he franchise and like competitive fighting games, otherwise, wait for a sale because it is definitively NOT worthy $100 in it´s current status with such a bare bone roster.

In all seriousness, the game is fantastic. The fights are fast, frenetic, and full of insane combos. It's got enough depth and variety that fighting game fans will find a lot of combo creativity, while also remaining accessible for those new to fighting games and just want to play casually with friends to wax nostalgic about DBZ, or to experience the story, which is exclusively made for the game and not just retelling the same arcs you've seen over and over again.

The game isn't without issues, though. The lobby system can be frustrating, especially to those who haven't played an Arcsys title before. It's meant to simulate the feeling of being in an arcade where anyone can come up and play you, but if you're just wanting to play with friends, it can be annoying to have to join an online lobby just to make a private game. Thankfully, they've added more lobbies so space isn't limited like it was at launch.

It looks and performs beautifully, with Arcsys making use of the shaders they made for GGXRD to make one of the most striking games I've ever seen. It LOOKS like you're playing the anime. Animations, music, and sound effects all evoke the spirit of DBZ, with close attention paid to get very minute details just right.

At the moment, I feel this is THE 2D fighter. The DBZ element should keep it relatively populated, which is an issue previous Arcsys games had. If you're a DBZ fan, there's SO much fun to be hard, with the game oozing fanservice and references and playing around with the cast.

39664101,english,"I can easily state that this is one of the best fighting games both visually and in terms of gameplay.

I played the Open Beta on PS4 about two weeks prior to this game's release and legitmately either mentioned or thought about this game once a day since the launch trailer shown back last summer during Microsoft's E3. Here is the crazy thing: this game lives up to all of the overflowing hype I had for it and goes even further beyond. As I am a DrgaonBall fan but see a lot of problems with the series as a whole (I don't want to be considered an apologist to all of the nonsense, with Super currently airing as well), and can't say it enough that this is my favorite DragonBall game by far, as I previosuly was a huge fan of Budokai Tenkaichi 3 and Raging Blast 2's 3D-plane gameplay. I can't say it enough how beginner-friendly this game is yet has so much extra tech to it where the even the most extreme members of the FGC (Fighting Game Community) fell in love with this game so fast as it has been slated for an overwhelming amount of upcoming tournaments (rightfully so), and even if you don't prefer a 2D-style fighting game but are a huge DBZ fan, you can find enjoyment here as well with the amount of work dedicated to the visuals, with 98% of every move (including even the most basic of punches/kicks) have been taken by various panels of the manga and scenes from the anime, with dramatic finishes to allow you to feel what you may have always wanted in a DragonBall game. 

The upcoming plans of DLC is definitely something to not be wary of in my opinion considering how every character in the current roster (including Android #21 and both SSJ Blue Goku/Vegeta) feel as they should and even if you don't prefer a ""heavy play-style"" such as Majin Buu or Android 16, you can see where someone who does prefer that style would enjoy those characters, both feeling like how those characters are in the show yet feeling like unique character types in a more traditional fighting game such as Marvel vs Capcom. Every character is viable in their own way, even Nappa with his Saibamen to Yamcha with his insane rush-down moves regarding his Wolf Fang Fist. I am leaning more towards characters such as Piccolo, Hit, and SSJ Vegeta (with the true God of Destruction Tien sprinkled in there for more variety) but I constantly switch between every character as each one is easily an adreline-rush to play. 

I have been trying to push this to others and plan to help others see why this game, even from a standpoint of hating DragonBall AND fighting games, has an endless amount of love placed DragonBall FighterZ for each of the fans a game like this appeals to: fighting game fans, DragonBall fans, and fans of games that clearly went all-out with their project.

39663828,english,"First and foremost, this is traditional 2D fighting game first and a Dragonball game second. To those coming from Xenoverse, this is NOT an arena fighter like that game

That said, Dragonball FighterZ is a great game with some minor nitpicks. The graphics are stylized to make the 3D models look like 2D sprites which makes look every character really crispy without losing that anime look.
The sound effects are straight from the show. No need to fix what isn't broken. The music is rocking good but I don't think it particularly memorable. Still puts you in a good fighting mood.

For gameplay, its made so that you can make a simple combo from mashing a single button so newbies of the genre dont get discouraged. Arc Systems has always had this on their games but as an option from separate from the technical style of inputs. The fact that its integrated by default into this game really takes away from that marvel of ""Wow, that combo was pretty cool"" Of course, the more seasoned fighting game players can still pull out a longer and more technically demanding combo just fine and deal with the auto-combos with relative ease. The game heavily rewards aggressive play, even giving you Ki just for walking forward. It feels a little unbalanced though compared with Guilty Gear Xrd which also heavily rewards aggressive play but also giving you quite a number of defensive tools. In this game, you only can rely on a good timed counter or a good timed Z-guard which basically a push back for the enemy.

Every character is similar to some degree, as in, they all share the same basic combo paths, do the same general type of attack with the same inputs (a sweep with low, medium. Anti-air with low, heavy, etc) So if you know one character, you basically can play the whole roster. That said, most of the cast has a diferent feel to each other and keeps things varied.

The story mode is cleverly designed and its definetly worth checking out. Lots of fighting with occasional dialog between the characters. Not to heavy on plot so its easy to enjoy.

39661226,english,"This game is worth all the money if you are a true Dragon Ball fan. Engaging single player story with a huge variety of cutscenes with each voice actor/actress (including Sean Schemmel, Christopher Sabat, Sonny Strait and Jason Douglas), beautiful graphics that truely make you appreciate that you don't need a guns blazing PC to even run it and addicting gameplay indeed. It's best with a controller, but thanks to it's simple and not so-complicated gameplay, a keyboard works fine for the time being if you do lack a controller.

Something extremaly convenient about the single player mode is that you get taught all the important techniques while fighting against the CPU opponents. In a lot of fighting games, the player would assume they'd have to pump up some iron a bit in a training mode against a dummy (which is still useful of course if you want to practice landing your combos), however in the story mode, you get taught all the basics, and advice tends to get repeated so it is quite unlikely you'll forget the neccassary moves in order to stand a chance against human opponents.

Speaking of which, as expected the online lobbies are simply stuffed with other eager to challenge warriors ready to duke out all of their ki energy on unsuspecting amateur clowns. However, it's far from impossible to find a room eventually (launch day should simply be excepted, it's something one should always prepare for, that little extra patience for expecting literally every single fresh new arrival at once), at times I did notice when trying to get into a casual match, I got random disconnections from the lobby, but it took little to no time to get back. Lobbies do fill up fast, but tend to lose players quickly at the same time, so just keep an eye out for numbers dropping.

With every character sporting their own unique movesets, you'll be putting in hours to gain knowledge just how each of them operate and obliterate. You can feel at ease knowing how easy it is to get the hang of just how the game plays, so much so that you can go in an online match instantly, study your opponent, and learn some methods out of him/her so you can improve yourself in the long term like a true Z fighter. Although of course as mentioned earlier, it's recommended you learn the controls in single player or training mode if you're in a rush to blast open some craters.

Who knew Marvel vs Capcom gameplay could transition so well into a Dragon Ball fighting game, perhaps M.U.G.E.N foretold the future, and even more excitingly, this means a crossover with another franchise would really work out.

39660118,english,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is the latest and greatest game from ArcSys, and dang it's pretty.

Pros:
-I have never seen an anime game capture the visual style of the actual anime so well. Everything in this game looks and sounds just like the anime, and the animations and super attacks are a treat to watch. On top of that, there's tons of visual touches such as opponents flying off into the terrain when defeated with a strong attack which make it even more intense to look at.

-The gameplay is incredibly fast paced and everything feels buttery smooth for a fighting game, and on top of that, despite the length and flashy-ness of combos, they're actually very easy to get into doing; the entirety of the game is, for that matter. Characters can perform simplistic combos by hitting the same buttons rapidly for people who just want to jump in and have fun, wheras they can also do much more complicated and damaging combos for those who want to invest the time to learn them. On top of that, all the game's specials are very easy to perform and remember, making it easy for players to switch up their team with different characters.

-The roster, while perhaps not exactly gigantic like other Dragon Ball titles, offers a great variety of unique characters to play with. Unlike other Dragon Ball games, everyone in this game feels very distinct from one another, from the simplistic all rounder gameplay of Goku, to the bizarre, projectile manipulating Beerus. 

-Unlike some modern fighting titles, this game released with a fair share of offline modes as well as online ones. For those who like to play offline, you've got access to your basic stuff like training modes, VS CPU and offline local play. Then, you have the Arcade Mode, which presents you multiple lines of battles against enemy CPU teams that vary in difficulty and character depending on how well you performed in the previous match. Then, there's a story mode, for those who're into the Dragon Ball story, where you can... Well, I suppose I'll leave that up to you to discover. It's your sort of standard fighting game story mode, but it's got some unique Dragon Ball flair to it and is surprisingly branching for a title in the series.

-Also worth a mention for being a personal favourite of mine; One of the online modes allows you to host a contest between 6 players, where rather than control an entire team yourself, each player controls a singular character on one side, and only controls the fight when they're tagged in. Though technically nothing mechanically changes about this mode, I found playing a match with two real allies against a team of 3 different opponents incredibly fun! It meant that each of my opponents was not only a different character, but also played differently, as were my partners. This does, however, bring us to the ""Mehs"" of the game.

Mehs:

-If you've heard people complaining about this game, it's probably about the online. The game is run on a lobby system, meaning from what I can tell, you only really match against the players who're in the same sort of hub world lobby as you. Theoretically this shouldn't be a problem, but there's about a 64 player limit on the lobbies, which means that it can be a little odd finding matches, and in populated countries, you might not actually find yourself able to get online. Personally, this isn't an issue for me, as the Oceanic servers have plenty of free slots, but it's worth considering.

-The online seems to vary in terms of quality. Though I've played several matches that felt absolutely seemless, I've also played matches where the game slows significantly and lags somewhat. Not unplayable, but it does feel a bit jarring compared to the blisteringly fast offline.

-For those seeking it, I do not believe that the game has an endless random CPU battle mode. You can fight endlessly in the offline battles, but the arcade ends after a set amount of matches depending on which one you select, and the teams seem to be pre-determined, though there's a great variety due to the way the battles change depending on your performance.


Overall however, Dragon Ball FighterZ is an absoluteley amazing fighting game. The gameplay is intense and epic, and offers a great balance of simplicity and complexity. The visuals are fantastic and the music has all kinds of great tracks. The roster is large enough to offer a good variety, and there are 8 DLC characters coming later to enlarge it further. The online is fun, but I suppose a little sketchy in terms of how frequently it works how you want it to. 

Should you get it? Heck yes. Despite a slightly flawed online, this is, in my opinion, the best fighting game to release in a long time. I've enjoyed it a ton so far, and I will continue to for a long time. It's been a while since a fighting game brought a real genuine smile to my face, as I played online in a 3v3 battle, tagging out to one of my partner's mid-combo and watching him seemlessly continue the combo into a super attack, accompanied by a little ""Nice!!"" message from the 3rd player watching. Truly, this is some of the most fun you're going to have with a fighting game or a Dragon Ball game.",1517073855,1517073855,TRUE,1,0,0.525862038,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,119,24,6869,0,1975,1600869575

8.5/10, best Dragon Ball game yet. The story is a bit of a hassle, same with trying to play with friends. But otherwise, it's a fun fighting games, even for people who doesn't watch Dragon Ball.

Get the game if you like fighting games OR want to get into fighting games like me! I seriously could not get into fighting games until Dragon Ball Fighterz came out.

39636311,english,"Alright, this game is a VERY mixed bag... Firstly let me just say that this game is not worth $60. Ultimate edition is a total robbery for $110 and I was suckered into getting it for my birthday. I'd like to point out not even Arc System Works has the stones to charge full price for their games and the're at the top for fighting games on PC. 

Initial Issues...

-Not enough servers, there's like what... 20 US East servers for 64 people per server? They're all full. No servers left.

-Attacks not registering properly on gamepad. (The super/ultimate combos are total 50/50's)

-Story is even more stupid and cliche than Xenoverse...

-All animated segments are running in 30fps or lower and just make me ill to look at. (2560x1440, 144hz monitor)

-No functional tutorial, instead the game tries to hand hold you with tutorials for the first 10 levels of the story, enemies die while trying to learn new moves.

And at this point in time, I can't really tell how solid the gameplay ACTUALLY is. It feels very slow and janky, when you get up to the enemy and fight it's way too fast, you can't even effectively counter unless you anticipated it. A lot of skills and perks are locked until you level up...? I don't really know whats going on with this game and the typical Japanese hub/UI doesn't help. 

I'm just going to wait until they patch this thing, and based on how much of a wreck it already is, and how many bad reviews it's got, I'd say that it's coming soon. I am not going to be scammed out of $110, if this doesn't get resolved I WILL be refunding and buy it on mass sale later. I wonder if I'll keep the pre-order and Ultimate edition bonuses... Probably.

EDIT: Upon further review... The game has glaring issues. 

The tutorial hand holding crap continues the whole game. You have this nasty tutorial message across you screen in 50% of fights for the whole campaign.

As for the combat it's pretty shallow. Sure you can combo differently for every situation, but it's entirely character based. The game feels so static and repetitive. You have to switch chars all the time or you WILL get bored.

The AI is broken. It'll be full brain-dead and not even fight back or move for the first half of the fight, then just go full kill mode. They really should put in a difficulty option for the AI it's never consistent. It's really all over the place.

The campaign and fights are pretty boring overall. Imagine xenoverse with the copy paste missions fights, but in 2D format. That's what the ""missions"" are in this game. You're playing for 10 second slivers of unique audio/cinematics between chars.

I really don't get the point of zeni in this game all it does is get you lobby cudtomization crap, not even outfits or anything, just your standard cod player card...

Tag team char swaping spam is a thing... Everyone online just swaps their char out the second they get hurt so 90% of the damage you inflicted heals. They either need to decrease the amount of hp fighters regenerate, slow it down, or make the character swap cool down longer. Don't expect an honest fight on ranked. I know it sounds scummy but everyone swap spams.

I'd just like to mention how a neck beard came here to defend the game about my anticipation, unpredictable block complaint. Guy told me it's the genre and I know lmao. This game has a problem with it though when you can stunlock the other person in a combo, spam supers along with char swaps to get 2 supers in, taking out 50-100% hp of your fighters. It's very questionable... There should be more ways to break out of attacks (ie using a ki bar to escape like xenoverse)

The connection isn't horrible but it's not good... At least you can set what connection your other opponent is so you don't fight someone in China, that's nice. I've had a handful of laggy frames but nothing too noticeable. (I play with 4 bars of connection or higher. Laggy frames aren't acceptable.) I'm totally baffled why it takes 5min to find a match when all the online servers are full, despite there being virtually none. (Good luck getting into one to play online.)

Meh, there's just not much to this game. It can have it's fun little bits, and the voice actors are great (for the most part). If you dont love the core of this game it isn't for you. They put in all these gamemodes and stuff but in the end it's all just 2D fighting. I know that sounds silly but it's true. Campaign is just 100 AI skirmishes with cinematics over and over. Arcade mode is the exact same as campaign it just doesn't have cinematics... And online battles are online battles. Everyone I've played has been horribly bad and can only play Yamcha.

There may be some negative reviews about the current lobby system and I agree, they need to make more space for more players asap, however I'm reviewing the gameplay, and it feels amazing.

The fighting mechanics are so intricate, that I can see myself practising and training for weeks to get good. The combos you can pull off alone, and then having the option to bring in other characters to the fight for assists and even further combos just add a whole new level of wow. The game is beautifully presented and it's mechanics and feel show that a great deal of passion went into this project.

Pretty fun. I am not a fighting game guru, at least not these fighting games. I prefer smash bros and rivals of aether, but I found the combat in the last few dragon ball games to suck so I picked this one up.

The combat seems pretty good, to me at least. The combos don't seem to long or do to much damage since there is no break out of combo button. 

But like I said,  I don't play these kinds of games. I just know I enjoyed this one.

As for any other aspect of the game, it seems kind of cheap. Not like cheap in a bad way, but the hub world is kind of bland and it uses little chibi looking sprites for you to interact with. I think just a standard menu would have been fine, but that little bit of extra effort to allow you to walk around and emote at people is pretty neat I guess. The stamps are stupid. I never understood the point of ""sprays"" and these stamps. But some people enjoy using and collecting them, so there is that if you're one of those people.

I got a constant 60 fps on my laptop. I have not played on my PC yet, but if I get a constant 60 on my decent enough laptop, I think my PC will run it just as well. It seems to be optimized very well. 

The graphics themselves are just so pretty. I wish the cutscenes used different art though. The cutscenes seem to use art from the previous Dragon Ball game styles, if that makes sense. They just don't look as good. But it's not a big deal since I just skipped them since the story was kind of boring to be honest.

39639330,english,"If i had to describe this game in one word it would be: UNDERWHELMING.

Let me start by saying that gameplay-wise, it does deliver... kinda... it does scratch that good old ""Dragon Ball Fighter Game"" itch that every one of us have at some point in life... but its far from being the best DBZ game there is, it is VERY GOOD don't get me wrong... but Budokai and Budokai Tenkaichi on PS2 are both vastly superior, which brings us to the problems that make me sadly give this game (that I was really looking forward to) a BAD review.

Graphics are good, the game is GORGEOUS, it looks like a Dragon Ball game from 2018 should and for the most part the fidelity to source material was a huge selling point for me 
EDIT: I figured what had me running with poor performance, I admit, my bad, game is indeed NICELY optimized for PC, moving this to the positive side of my review.

Let's go in order... first thing the game prepares you for... takes FOREVER to find a lobby, first time I found one right away, then every time after I now realize how UNDERWHELMING this system is, you have 6 regions to chose from, all of them have several lobbys, USA having the most obviously, but even if we do basic math... the developer expected like... 1000 players at most to want to use the lobby at the same time?, sure every time you enter a new activity it takes you out of the lobby which helps for newcomers, but 1 This means you are always looking for lobby room and 2 It is still 99% of the time full so you end up going to the OFFLINE lobby, and if you are doing story mode or arcade thats fine but for an ONLINE fighting game you already lost access to major content.

Speaking of which, the story... boy is this story mediocre, now, obviously when having a Dragon Ball game for the story mode you have 2 options basically, either have us do the whole story of the original series (like Budokai and Tenkaichi did), or come up with underwhelming crap that justifies you battling everyone without breaking the lore or have it just be a tournament... this game sadly chose the second option... *Spoilers* you are... YOU, somehow linked to Goku's body (later you can link with everyone else as you unlock them), because thats who I want to be while playing dragon freaking ball... MYSELF... this in a convoluted way means that even though you are in the body of Goku, who already lorewise is at his strongest point you are technically weakest than every single dragon ball character ever... yaaay... well, no, Goku is your guardian spirit who cant fight, and the story treats YOU as if you have 1% of his power even though during fights you can use everything right away, oh and why or how are you fighting everyone else? theres an army of clones... so... Sonic Forces but with you and Goku sharing a body instead of being a new fighter which btw was a really cool feature from the Xenoverse series that would've been better for this game... but they had to force the gimmick of 3v3 by justifying it in so YOU can only inhabit 1 body at a time so... 3 v 3 battles taking turns! It doesn't even make any sense, if you can create any number of Gokus why would you ever fucking waste cloning resources on Yamcha, Tien, Krillin, etc!? Vegeta at least I would understand but for crying out loud, have every clone in your evil army be Goku! the villain already has intentional design flaws on its master plan and I havent even finished the first arc!!!

By the way... lip sync! what minor thing that we take for granted... yeah, during the ""cutscenes"" of the story mode no matter which language you chose, 50% of the lines are in proper sync with mouth movement (to an extent at least, you know... them not moving their mouths when they shut up and such), I understand that you cant lip sync 2 languages to generic mouth movement but at least sync it to ONE language! oh wait no, you actually can, like any big title that has multi language support has done since the era of the first cutscenes that had lip movement, otherwise I'd rather have the cutscenes be with standstills of the characters, it gets terribly distracting and now that I mentioned it you will be forced to press A to advance the lines as soon as they finish saying them so that you are not annoyed by it as much as I am. 

Edit: The hand holding is so terrible! no matter how far you are into the story, you will ocasionally have 30% of your screen covered by ""Press A + X to charge your Ki"" bitch I've recharged my Ki in DBZ games before you even existed!

Now, since you got bored of the painfully boring story, you force your way into a lobby and queue up for an arena match, or a casual match, or hell... anything! as long as you get to beat the shit out of someone else in awesome dragon ball fashion it doesnt matter!... well NO, even if the lobby is FULL as hell, queueing on anything takes forever to find a match, casual matches against people with any connection on any level... I couldnt find one in 30 minutes, arena matches I found 1 in 10 minutes of trying, directly challenging a player didnt work either HOW CAN YOU MESS THIS UP SO MUCH!? If I queue on a CASUAL unranked match just throw whoever's on the game, don't ask me to luck out on one of the people in the lobby to want to do the same activity as me and ACCEPT my match after waiting like 15 minutes to find it in the first place! (yes, you can DENY a match, why would you if it took you forever to find it I dont know... genius design... I obviously purchased DRAGON BALL to wait in imaginary lines and investigate and carefully decide if i want to fight the guy I've been waiting for hours).

Music is decent, the generic stuff you expect, supposedly there are some remixes of the original tracks from the anime, I have yet to find a single one, the new ones are underwhelming...

And honestly, I dont know what else to say, I had to stop playing to write this lengthy review, because when the action is so good, fast paced and awesome that obviously you have time to simply WANT to stop to instead write an essay on how much fun you could be having but are for some reason NOT having that is always a good sign right!?.

I bought DRAGON BALL and I am fighting using a freaking SUPER SAIYAN, HOW am I bored enough to want to write a fucking review instead!?

Speaking of which, character roster! underwhelming! as expected from a fighting game of 2018, you get like the most basic posible fighters out of a MEMORABLE cast, and everything else is going to come as DLC, if EVER, gone are the days when developers wanted to give you every single fighter that dragon ball has ever shown (Budokai Tenkaichi anyone?), why would I, on release, want to play as Tien Shinhan instead of... I dont know, literally anyone else? hell, male/female broly for instance is a BIG one that should be here, and sure, now we want to pretend that every movie ever released doesnt count, how convenient! its not that we are lazy, its that those interesting fighters are not canon! well then WHY are we missing the fighers from Dragon Ball Super? isnt this game a cashgrab for that anime!?

Right now I give this game a 4 out of 10 because the lobby is bullshit, the story is uninteresting, the music is generic, roster is lacking and unappealing and I havent even mentioned glitches, cause YEAH I already experienced some in my first 2 hours of playing the game (mostly related to music and audio and one instance where during gameplay it kept changing from fullscreen to windowed, nothing major).

If they ever fix glitches and somehow throw that useless lobby to replace it for a better matchmaking, I would raise it to a 7 out of 10, as it is you'd rather play Budokai on PS2 than waste any time on this mediocre thing... oh sorry, I was using the word ""underwhelming"" wasnt I?

With the major downside of games like Guilty Gear and BlazBlue having been their niche appeal, Dragon Ball FighterZ has drawn in a broad player base of seasoned fighting game veterans and casual newcomers alike.

This game delivers all of the mechanical polish that Arcsys is known for, including the fantastic net code, and couples it with an extremely approachable “easy to learn, difficult to master” playstyle that sits somewhere in between an ABC fighter such as Injustice and a technical anime fighting game such as Guilty Gear.

Further to this, Dragon Ball FighterZ manages to capture the fast paced battles that pop into our minds whenever we think Dragon Ball, without it becoming a cluttered mess like games such as Marvel (Think Star Wars Prequels).

All in all, this game has everything you could possibly want from a fighter including tactile/super fun mechanics, fantastic graphics/sounds, solid IP, net play and single player content for those seeking a more casual experience. It is a game that literally anyone can get into easily and one that is being embraced by a myriad of players from all walks of life.

In all seriousness though, it's a great game. No it isn't Budokai, or Xenoverse, or any other Dragon Ball game. Thank Kami. I like DBZ games, but none of them are great games. Some are pretty fun, yeah, but you can't really fairly say that you'd just want to sit down and play them for hours if they weren't Dragon Ball related. This one is different in that the core game is great, and the devs love Dragon Ball on top of that making it a fantastic adaptation. Every move is straight out of the series, character interactions that are all interesting and fun between characters you don't necessarily expect, and mechanics simple enough for a beginner such as myself to fighting games not to feel terribly intimidated by the game, yet deep enough to satisfy fans of the genre and make it quite competetive to boot. My only complaints so far are related to Bandai Namco's unfortunate troubles not releasing at midnight and allowing for enough servers to accomodate the millions of DBZ fans that will pick this game up. There are a few handful of servers capable of holding 64 players each, so you'll probably have to play offline. But that's fine with a story mode that has a boardgame look to it like some previous DBZ games and a fairly interesting story where most of Earth's defenders have been weakened by mysterious waves, with the only hope being you, the player, being able to ""link"" into other characters to fight a mysterious and somewhat familiar threat.

The music is awesome, if a little on the repetitive side since there are a lot of dialogue scenes in this game where you'll here one of a few tracks, but typically the action and the conversations are engaging enough for me to overlook it.

Goku and the entire DBZ cast look better than they ever have in any other video game, beating out even Xenoverse 2's graphics by a considerable margin in terms of proper homage to the designs within the franchise. The effects are gorgeous and there have to be dozens of little nods to the series within the roster, with most, if not all attacks, having appeared in the Dragon Ball manga/anime at one point or another.

The gameplay is super crisp and smooth. I don't have the chance to play fighting games often, FighterZ only being my second 'real' fighter, however, I still found much enjoyment in the game, even when I floundered around trying to figure out how to do some proper non-automatic combos. New players to the genre will have fun and will quickly pick up on the intricacies of the combat, whilst genre veterans will be able to pull off awesome combos where you can truly feel like you're a part of the Dragon Ball universe.

I have not tried the online component, so I will not comment on it quite yet.

Overall, 9.5/10. An absolutely amazing game that both fighting game fans and Dragon Ball fans will adore for a long time.

I'm not usually a fan of fighting games, but games like DBZ Budokai always were an exception and had a special place in my heart growing up. When I heard there was a new fighting game in the DBZ universe coming out, I jumped at the chance to play it. 

The game seems relatively straightforward, the controls (while taking a while to get used to on a xbox controller) are relatively easy to pick up and understand. 

The biggest issue with the game is the amount of servers that are available. If you take a look, there's only around 40 or so servers in the US West and East regions, each. In smaller regions, there's maybe a handful of servers, and each server holds up to 64 players concurrently. Given the popularity of the game, there is no way to play it at the moment. In the time from when I bought the game to the hour after when I decided to return it, I spent most of that time disconnecting from a lobby after being the last person in, only to find all of the lobbies full after I got kicked. 

The only place where I was consistently able to connect were the UK and Japan servers, but that led to their own issues of poor connection quality. When I did fight someone, I was either able to watch as my team was helplessly defeated, with me being unable to really offer any input whatsoever, or I was just outright kicked from the match. 

I want to like this game, but since most of my time within that one hour was spent just trying to connect to the game, I have to say I'm a little disappointed, and a little worried that anyone wanting to spend any amount of time on this game is going to spend the majority of it waiting to connect to a full lobby, if at all.",1517032762,1517032762,FALSE,2,2,0.428714961,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,76,1,1164,0,560,1578694840

39646429,english,"If you want something short and sweet here it is.  Buy the game for the online because its pretty fun. Story alone isnt worth 60 bucks but the product (the game) runs/plays/feels great. Any cons are related to servers/peoples bad computers.

From my 8 hours so far. I've beaten the main story (63% completeness)  and have about 40 fights against other players. What I can tell you is its very easy to pick up but very hard to master. If you're looking for a ground breaking DBZ story this game might not be for you. It's pretty good but if you will never touch the online then its not worth it. However once you get to online oh my god is it fun. They have a currency in-game. It's called zeni, which in the DBZ universe is their money. Basically you play matches or the story and you get zeni. You use this zeni to open up capsules and get avatars/emotes. Simple but honestly really enticing. For now I keep fighting people in the hopes I can get a super rare Gohan avatar. (that may or may not exist).

As I said at the start the real issue for us PC players is that they gave 40  servers across America (My country) with 14 for US East/West Coast and 4 for Mexico/Canada (East/west). With a total size of 64 players per server. So roughly 3k people can play at a given time and thats way to few. A lot of people are haten on this game because thats really the only bad things thats going on. That and being disconnected a few times (which I can confirm has happened to me) but it happens. 

Overall I think this game has a bright future. Has plenty to offer a new person or a veteran to fighting games and it will get better.",1517032528,1517032528,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,230,38,1282,0,596,1528006401

39646325,english,"so, Ive been playing the game for 10 hours now, and heres my thoughts.
   
>Story-the story is really fun. great cutscenes that dont feel too choppy, great mapping system that mixes together RPG with 2d fighter. so far ive gotten up to the part where i save android 21 from cell, so i have a long way to go but so far i really enjoy it

>Gameplay-its absolutely amazing. no question there. as nice of the idea it is to have a 3d open fighter dragonball game, it just doesnt work. it cant work with how fast the reality of dragon ball is. thats why dragon ball is destined for 2D side scrolling. its able to balance speed and flow, and for that reason is able to make you feel fast af boi without getting too overwhelmed.

>Graphics-oh my god, this is probably the best part of the game. everything before ultimate tenkaichi=great graohics (especially for the limitations it had). ultime tenkaichi=stiff and awkward models. raging blast= semi stiff and awkward models. battle of Z- how do they talk with their mouths closed (thinking emoji). extreme budoten= 3ds limitations. xenoverse= how could you make the characters any more glossy and shiny, dear god its ugly. dokkan battle= lmao mobile players. now, fighterZ= LSD TRIP, WHAT A RIDE ONCE IN A LIFE TIME EXPIRENCE HOLY SHEET. (accurate representation). point is- naruto and one piece games found their perfect art style years ago. dragon ball just found theirs today. perfection.

>multiplayer- me personally, i have yet to expirence connectivity issues with opponents. im sure ive only gotten lucky though, as most games on release have awful connectivity issues. really fun, if youre playing with randoms that is. good luck trying to play with your friends, as well described in the next section

>servers- this is the worst part of the game. have fun trying to get into a server. 99% of the time the servers are ALL full. bandai decided ""hey, we know EVERYONES hyped about this game, so lets make sure only around 2000 people of the 300 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE US be allowed to be in online servers at a time. lets put this into a perspective i like to call 'comparisons'. take a game such as, i dont know... black ops 2? the game is 5 years old and yet, the player base on average right now is about 10000-20000 people at a time. so now take fighter Z. a brand new game that has been preordered HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES by now. so lets just say 100,000 people are playing this game right now in the U.S alone. only 2000 of those people, aka 1/50 of those players are able to play online. the other 48/50 are stuck in offline mode, meaning they can only fight CPU's. WHO THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA? on top of that, if you wanna play with a friend, you guys have to be in the same serve. considering its nearly impossible right now to get in a server, imagine trying to get you and your buddy in the same server.

>optimization- its not that bad for PC controls tbh. i have WASD for movement, and im using the number pad for my attacks. works nicely, feels comftoable. the only gripe i have is that theyre expecting you to play with an xbox contoller, instead of saying ""use W A S D to move"" it says ""use UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT STICKS to move"". so once you can get past that confusion, the controls are alright. as for graphics, i have the best of the best (ex. 1080 ti) so i have no problem with maxing out graphics. so the one thing i cant review this game on is how well it performs for less powerful computers.

>currency- yes, this game has lootboxes. yes, they are wonderful. I know, its usually weird hearing lootboxes and wonderful in the same sentence, but they made lootboxes how theyre supposed to be made; purely cosmetic. no boosts or passives to give you an extra hand in the battle, no character unlocks (imagine that, unlocking Beerus through RNG lmao). the lootboxes give you hub avatars, icons, banners, stickers, things like that. they dont change the outcome of the game, they simply give you a reason to keep playing, and thats why i love it.

>Hub world- i hear a lot of people complaining about this one. personally i like it. i think its neat that all the modes you can do can be accsesed in a tiny little hub. think of xenoverse. that hub world was HUGE. very hard to get to the shop when youre on the other side of the map, so there i could see why people would complain. but here? it takes 5 seconds to go from the shop to literally anywhere else in the map. so to those complaining that its making the game take forever to get from one mode to the other: calm down lmao.

>characters. finally, the fighterz in the game. and the answer is, theyre just eh. yes, the special moves they have are BEAUTIFUL and are the exact reason im not gonna totally and completely shit on this section, but lets be real, 80% of the time, youre not using a special move, youre just using normal moves, and unfourtunately, ALL the normal combos and moves are nearly identical for each character (with the exception of trunks, blaze that sword into battle baby). technically speaking, none of them have an exact reused moveset as another character, but relitavely speaking, god do they feel so similar. this usually happens with every fighting game though, its very hard to make a punch from one character feel completely different from a punch that another character has (expect for smash bros, love that unique shit).

SUMMARY
--------------------
so, youve made it this far into the review, ayy lmao thanks for reading. let me go ahead and sum it all up for you guys.

Story: 8/10 (so far)
Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 10/10
Multiplayer: 7/10
Servers: 0/10
Optimization: 6/10
Currency: 9/10
Hub world: 8/10
Characters: 5/10
Sexiness of my man Tien and his forehead viens: 10/10

Total: 72/100

This game gets a C+ rating for being the game dragon ball fans have always wanted, but just having too many problems at the beginning. as soon as this game fixes the problems with the servers, and fixes the problems with those who dont use an xbox controller, THEN this game with be likely getting an A.

now, for those of you who read all this, ill reward you with a joke. what do you call a cow that loves to pleasure himself? Beef Strokemoff :)

39635432,english,"Arc systems and Bandai have given full support to play FighterZ with a keyboard but there's no support in sight for fight sticks? 

 Hori literally made a new fightsick specifically for DBfighterz and the game has no support for them on PC? What a joke. The game itself is great but it's a real bummer when you practice and get used to using an arcade stick for this game during the betas only to be forced to use a game pad upon release. Very disappointing. Fight stick support needs to be added ASAP.

Edit: Im fully aware of the the different steps that can be taken To ensure fight stick functionality. The steam settings route did nothing for me but the x360 set up route was successful and I currently have full use of my TE2+ stick. 

My intention in leaving a negative review was not to slander the game itself but to bring attention to the devs about something that, in my eyes, is unacceptable for a 60$ game. The ratio of people that can’t get their sticks to work vs the people that have zero issues is exactly why the developers need to be made aware of the problem and fix this. I was lucky, some people aren’t. 

That being said, I am going to change my review to a thumbs up since it’s not entirely fair to steer people away from this game based on this single issue. Just want to make sure that this controller caveat is made clear to anyone who intends to buy this game. It’s awesome and fun, a 10/10 dragon ball game and a phenomenal fighting game at that.

39645832,english,"This game is fun, let me start with that. Despite any other greivances that I or anybody may have with this game it is almost certainly one of the most fun (for the non-fighting game player, which many people are) fighting games out at the moment and it's easy of access and low-skill requirement is sure to draw more people in.
Arc System works has done a great job making a Dragonball game here and make no mistake because that is what this is, it makes absolutely no attempt to be a reskined Guilty Gear(despite the graphical similarities), Blaze Blue, or any of their other projects. The effortless combos, rediculous power levels, and world shattering specticals make sure of it and it's fine that it isn't BB or GG because it makes no attempt to be.

Quick Pros:
-Fast Paced Fun
-Dragonball
-Made by a dev team who knows(more or less) what they're doing
-It's just fun

Quick Cons:
-Online is kind of terrible
-The UI is shit

The two cons above are really the only non-subjective downsides that I can offer but you should note they're pretty big. The online mode forces you to go into a 64 player max lobby, This *could* be fine if there were an unlimited amount of these and if there were other ways to play with people but there isn't. For any given region (in NA) that I've seen you have at most a dozen or so lobbies, meaning in the whole of North America there can be at most ~1000 people playing online. Now you might say ""Well surely I could just play with my friends, I don't have to be in a lobby"" No person reading this on steam, you can not. To play with ANYONE you and the other person have to be in the same lobby together.
Granted, however, playing online is very decent. I've only experienced lag once over the course of 40-ish games.

The UI isn't actually too bad itself it's just moderately annoying having to go into a lobby(there is an offline lobby) to do anything, even quite to title.

Ultimately I don't regret my purchase and I would/do recommend this game because the gameplay is just that good. It's still early on in the game's life (less than one full day on PC) so let's hope Arc Systems gets their shit together and fixes this godforsaken online.",1517030038,1517030038,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,263,4,4184,51,1041,1601935173

I'm going to present the points that make me don't want to play the game and ask for a refund.

_Points_

The online multiplayer sucks (this is what kills the game for me):
Get your shits together ArkSys, is the same thing over and over with you. Why don't you listen to people and implement Rollback Netcode. You do NOT need NASA engineers to implement it. You have money, use it in the places you are lacking.

* There is a lot of input delay with people near and in the country (in this case Chile and Argentina).
* Lobbies are always full.
* The game isn't using rollback netcode (already mentioned)

The game feels like is in beta:
Looks half baked, is like you focused too much in the Gameplay (well, I can't blame, gameplay >> menus) and the pretty (in battle) assets.

* The ring's logic is dumb: Why there only can be two active battles peer ring if it can accept a lot of people (was 8? can't remember)? The only thing you cause with this is people jumping from ring to ring.
* The overworld is a waste of time: I still don't know why they are using this idea again (this came from GGXrd iirc, some people like it and others don't). Good lobby implementation are the simple ones, straight to the point (skull Girls, GGXX series, BB series, KI).
* The large EULA you need to ""read"" and accept to play the game (LMAO, to ""skip"" it you need to hold the down button for like 1 min... at least you only need to do it once... right?).

_Conclusion_

So, based on the previous points and IMHO this game isn't worth 59.99 USD + DLC. It feels like it should cost 19.99 to 29.99 USD... b-but you have to pay the creators of DB for the rights to use the franshise... na, isn't worth it.

39645408,english,"Calling the lobby system ill-conceived is an understatement, I rarely even manage to auto-join lobbies.

I'm in Texas (no Midwest, South, Central, w/e servers btw, you get to pick between East Coast and West Coast with no in-between) and in order to netplay with other friends from Texas we had to meet up on the Venezuela server or the Middle East servers.

That being said, online works on garbage. I'm running a GTX 1070 with an i5-6600k and 16GB ram, yet somehow this game destroys my machine on the recommended settings; something about online play makes Windows think it's malware or something and causes Windows Defender to eat up 20% of my CPU resources. This wouldn't be an issue but DBFZ will take up over 70% CPU randomly while (apparently) not fully utilizing my GPU. I'll be playing and randomly my FPS will drop down to 1-2. This only happens with online play, and while I'm willing to blame Windows, this never happens in other games, so I believe DBFZ is the culprit.

6. Story is a lot of stuff to do - !!! Timewise !!! (have 40% of story completed and im like 5,5 -6,5 hours in story alone)

[b][h1]BAD STUFF:[/h1][/b]

1. connection problems (might be a release-day problem only, can't tell more right now. some disconnects etc....)
2. Combosystem feels not amazing - it feels like you could choose any character available, and the combo / super / whatever button-combo is always the same - only very few differences
3. Story - scroll down, i'll explain.
4. Price! 94 bucks for the game + a few characters (DLC later?) feels a bit too much for a fighting game tbh. 

----

yes there are kinda low amount of servers. they should have doubled or trippled the amount of servers in the beginning weekend for sure - just to be safe. so you CAN struggle to get on a server, or choose a server that is already filled up with some other guy. happens, not too annoying tbh.

losing connection is annoying, but happened like 4 times in like 9 hours of playtime, which is totally fine for me. (i played the Storyfor the most time so far)

to the Story mode - little SPOILER!!! - its kinda easy mode story-telling happening. You (the player) are the ""Soul"" that is linked to different fighters over the story-timeline. they call it ""linked"". the characters are not able to fight without these link. they are trying to get rid of it with the help of Bulma.

once you beat the first part of the ""Story"", with the good guys, you have to do the same story from the bad boy perspective, but actually its exactly the same story. bla bla .... soul.... bla bla ....link .... bla bla .... we must get rid of it.... which is kinda unspectactular and dismal.

Then there is a little bit of real story, when it comes to Android 21, but there is actually not much to say, and i dont want to spoiler this part for anyone who is interested in playing it. 

finishing this writing, i really hope this game doesnt get boring after a few days, so my 94 bucks wont hurt that much.
in general, great game, would recommend to any Dragon Ball fan out there, but not absolutely the 94 bucks version right now - but that will show the time and the announces of the ""new"" characters. 59 bucks for the game right now is a bit too much for a fighting game, but whatever.

The Good

- It's easy to pick up and learn, you'll be able to do an optimal combo in no time
- It has a fully featured, reasonably fun story mode.
- It has a fully featured, fun Arcade Mode
- It has a reasonable lobby system when it works, the only issue right now would be trying to get in the same lobby as a few friends to make a party room or whatever it's called.

The Bad:

- Every lobby in my region is 64/64, either add a dynamic system that adds more lobbies as they fill up or give us an extra 10 per region (why does japan have 4 when china has 10?)

- The game runs as choppy as can be on an i7 7600k + 1070 with dropped frames everywhere.

- The combo trials show the default bindings instead of whatever you have your buttons bound to, and the combo trials are relatively weak and easy to execute compared to what is possible.

- A few characters are locked behind single player gameplay and require you to finish story mode arcs or arcade mode challenges to unlock them.

- Every cinematic is 24fps (including mid game) and is jarring to deal with when it's mid combat.",1517021843,1517021857,FALSE,4,0,0.506858051,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,734,86,707,0,119,1523002565

+Fantastic Visuals 
+Authentic Dragon Ball experience more than any of the other Dragon Ballfighters up until now

+Excellent presentation and a fine entry to the competetive fighter industry.

Neutral but noteworthy:
~Game is only 4.6 GB really, but it doesn't feel like a small game when you get into it at all. Probably just small because of the amount of 2D assets and basic textures.

Cons
-I tried 2 different fightsticks and neither of them worked; they are popular ones that work in literally every other fighter game out right now. No fightstick support really hurts this game.
-Online lobby mode is a mess. When you go to connect it's like there are only 4 servers of 64 players max for your area and they are always just constantly full.
-Game feels limited. Anyone familiar with dragonball games is going to expect a huge roster and all types of special moves and such....here you get a much more limited character selection; I expected this to mean the ones they focused on would be that much deeper but in reality they are just more balanced...their movelist has shrunken considerably.

I would pick this game up 100% absolutely...in the near future if possible; maybe not just right yet, give them a week and see if they fix the lobby and fightstick problems, if they do that; then it is certainly worth picking up.

Play the story which is actually really good.

While character selection being dropped down to 21(I think) characters without including DLC and ones yet to be released, is a bit of a disapointment after coming from Xenoverse or Tenkaichi, the depth of each character and the unique interactions kinda makes up for it.

39641041,english,"ok here goes.

Dragonball FighterZ is hands down my favorite Dragonball game TO DATE and heres why.

The game has about 26 fighters to play as. sadly it is dissaponting that they have 2 versions of goku and vegeta and are basically seperate characters but they have the same move sets apart from their specials. but besides that hiccup the other problems with the game are very easy to fix. such as the lack of open servers from the U.S. which im sure Bandai Namco and Arc System Works are looking into fixing fairly soon. 

The Story:
The Story taking place between the Goku Black and Tornament of Power Arcs is perfect cause it adds to Supers canon and so far has a lot of potential. as well as the fact that the story is all about saving the other fighters and leveling them up which i find increadiably fun and it fits very well with the fighting game formula. basically in a nut shell it takes the fighting game genre and flips it on its head for the story mode.

The Gameplay:
Fighting in this game feels very Dragonaball. from the sounds to the hits and whenever Gohan says SHIEET i lose it. (if you dont know where thats from or havent heard Gohan say it go watch Team Four Star). i myself am terrible at fighting games. im much more accustom to shooters and other such genres but my love for dragonball and this game in general is making me give fighting games an actual chance and so far im not dissapointed. and its increadiably easy to pick up but hard as hell to master so if you into that then you might like the game's brand of mechanics.

Loot Box:
i decided to speak on this for a second, yes the game has loot boxes but not shitty greedy awful ones. in fact you cant even buy them with actual money. the game handles how it gives you Zeni and the Premium Z coins very well and its nice to have a sort of purpose to play all of the modes. to continously unlock new lobby avatars and Z stamps and such that im glad they have this system in and i hope you agree with me that Cosmetic Loot Boxes are always a nice thing if implemented properly (I.E. cant purchase them with actual money).

Conclusion:

What I like:
Graphics
Brand
moves
Tutorial for learning the moves is very responsive and is not as F* as xenoverse 2's was for masters and their combinations. (tutorial is built into story mode)
No Anticheat to mess up game or computer 


Problems I see out the gate but will probably be addressed with updates.

Graphics settings are not saving for me (resolution)
Partying with friends is a real Pain and should honestly cost someone their job
The Lobby.   Barely any open spots and someone really thought this was a good idea?   Again someone needs to lose job
Game automatically takes you to ONLINE Lobby instead of offering private lobby initially. 
In order to play with friends you and your friends MUST join the same online lobby in the same rejoin.  

Problems that will not see a fix.

the story is half baked and completely predictible.
Menu's are a nightmare 
Party / competitive play is Peer 2 Peer and not server hosted.   
Only thing server hosted is Lobby that you have to join to play with friends. 
  

Dragonball FighterZ is a solid entry and I am glad that I have it in my library.  I am a huge fan of the anime and I am sure that there is Biasm in my statements towards that effect.   If I lived under a rock and did not know what Dragonball Z is I doubt I would feel the same way.  This game does leave alot of room for improvement for future iterations/sequels.  However, If playing with friends was made simplier and more streamlined in future patches I believe that this game would approach the price tag.   Currently, It is definatly overpriced and does not offer an amazing experience that leaves you craving more.  No, this game game is not worth the money and is only worth it to DBZ Fans who simply love anything DBZ related.",1517009688,1517009688,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,942,36,2375,0,283,1573095695
39640556,english,"An excellent fighter, let down by what is by far the most awful online system I have ever had the misfortune to experience. There are no private lobbies, you cannot host your own game. If you want to play with your friends, you need to arrange to meet in a public lobby. This might not be so bad if there were ample public lobbies, but Arc System Works has underestimated demand to a comical extreme. There are just 6 public lobbies for the UK, each which can take only 64 players. In a country of 63 million people, Arc System Works didn't consider the possibility that more than 384 people might buy their game.

Other countries have similarly low limits, and finding a public lobby becomes an exercise in trying out country after country until one with low player numbers can be found. Even when a lobby is found, your problems are only just beginning. Despite a player limit of just 64, the servers are laggy and error prone. Setting up a match was an exercise in frustration - either the player's avatars didn't show up, or when trying to join a room a mysterious ""room full"" error would occur, even when the room only had 2/8 occupants.

Even if there were sufficient servers, and the bugs in the servers fixed so that the game could actually be played, the interface Arc System Works has designed is a textbook example of how not to design a user interface. Instead of menus, players have to wander around a map with avatars and actually locate each other before they can play together. Functionally that would normally be reached through a menu, like going into practice mode, or changing the lobby, are instead hidden behind non-descript NPCs you have to talk to.

It's impossible to understate how terrible every aspect of this system is. Arc System Works have created an truly excellent multiplayer game, and then made it virtuallty impossible to play online. The excellence and the gameplay and visuals make the incompetance of the online experience all the most jarring.",1517009172,1517009172,FALSE,157,17,0.584076047,19,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,367,2,1275,0,460,1518053295

Except, to play at all, you need to be online. So I couldn't even play the story mode.

The gameplay is excellent. It really, really is. As a low level fighting game palyer, I really was getting the hang of it and having a serious blast.

39640326,english,"The fighting mechanics are solid, and the tutorials are pretty good, but the lobby and ""hub"" that works as the main ""menu"" of the game is absolutely atrocious. They're a confusing and convoluted mess that result in a very poor experience and seem intent on doing their best to keep you from actually getting into fights with others.

To give an example, if you want to play with a friend, you have to:

1. Ensure you both pick the same Region to play in.
2. Ensure you both pick the same lobby to enter. At the time of writing, most lobbies are full and you have to just retry over and over until you get lucky. You cannot create your own.
3. Once you're both in the same lobby, you must create an ""Arena"" with rulesets and an optional password
4. Your friend must find you in the hub, enter this Arena, and challenge you

Want to pick another lobby? You have to exit to title, re-choose region, re-choose lobby, and go. At the time of writing you'll be randomly kicked from a lobby due to server strain. There is no other way to play with friends. What in the world were they thinking..?

You cannot see what lobby you're in once you're in. Since it remembers between game restarts, that's... not ideal.

Pros:
- Fantastic presentation
- Well developed roster with all your favorites
- Excellent in depth fight system that is better than the new Marvel VS Capcom
- Original story with a new villain
- Optimized
- Funny, characters roast each other often and joke around, story is at it's best when it doesn't take itself too seriously
- You don't have to be a fan of DB to enjoy it..
- Alot of content
- Characters are varied and unique.
- Music has alot of metal, rock, and other appropriate music.
- You have to unlock SSB Goku and Virgina, and it's challenging like it should BE!

Cons:
- Dialogue is occasionally cringy, usually when the characters are trying to be serious.
- No fightstick support, which I don't care about, but others might. Controller works just fine though.
- Just little weird nuances that might bother you.

Im playin now like 4 Hours since the Release on PC. So far the performance is insane good.
Im just a Fighter Casual, but for me as a Dragonball Fan its just awesome. Every Button i hit is without input lag
or any other lags. Playin with PS4 Controller. Till now not a single crash.

## Lobbys and Tutorials ##

When you start the Game you can choose your Region and the Lobbys. Depending on your Country, the Lobbys
may be full. Its hard to get into the same Lobby with Friends. We have now between 40k-50k Players.
Thats simply insane. But still no Reason to give this game a bad review just because there are a lot of Players.

You can start with every Gamemode you want. I prefer the Storymode and the Tutorials to see all possible Combos.

39639059,english,"For those of you with crappy PC's and are worried about whether or not you can run this game.
My specs are for the most part, hitting the required fields for this game to run. i7 intel core. 8 gb RAM. 64 bit processor. However, my pc is well under the minimum 1 gb vRAM requirement. for any 3D game, this would mean I'd have to sacrifice FPS in order to get this game playing, which for a fighting game would be unplayable. Despite this, Arc-Sys has done a lot of  optimizing as well as giving an absolutley huge range of supported graphical options. If your PC is like mine and isn't exactly a good gaming computer, you should be able to still hit that sweet 60fps without frame drops if your willing to lower the quality a tad.

That's not to say this game is perfect. The lobbys are unnecessarily small making online kinda not worth it at this point. Not to mention there is currently no way to invite friends to play online against you.
I've also seen the forums get flooded with ""No Arcade stick support"" rants. I'm currently using a Hori RAP V (Which is essentially the exact same as the RAP IV, but with Nintendo Switch Support) and I did'nt even know this was an issue until I hopped off and saw everyone complaining.

As far as gameplay goes, it's not exactly super in depth for a fighting game. Certain mechanics are dumbed down a bit. It's not as if it's a super simple game with no room for improvement (such as generic AAD fighting games), but its also not quite as in depth as BlazBlue and nowhere near as in depth as Guilty Gear (the two biggest Arc-Sys Fighing games). 

As a Dragon Ball game, you'll probably find this game a little more difficult than the standard fare. In most DB games, you've probably found yourself trying to go around enemy attacks and throwing out supers whenever you can. Since this a fighting game, there is also the requirment of understanding combos. There is the ""Easy combo system"" (Pressing light over and over), but that won't get you very far beyond the main story mode. It's nowhere near as hard to get into as other fighting games, but you probably won't be able to win online if you don't practice a lot.

If you are wondering about the roster size, keep in mind this is a real fighing game. Other DB games get by on their large rosters by reusing a lot of attacks over different characters. It's not hard (comparitively speaking) to copy over similar animations for different characters. For example, in XV2, a lot of characters have nearly identical animations for most attacks in order for them to save time and money on development. You won't be finding anything like that here (Even among characters like Blue Goku or Teen Gohan, a lot of moves are completely different, though there is SOME copy and paste animation)

Overall, I found this game to be amazing in most regards. As it is right now, if you're on the fence about it, don't worry. It's not going anywhere, and when you do pick it up, it'll likely be even better than it is now.",1517004380,1517004380,TRUE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,7.65612E+16,117,2,2499,0,276,1600380396

Edit: If you still don't know how to configure your controller, go to Settings, Controller, then General Controller Settings. Plug it in and define the layout, save it and it should be recognized by every Steam game from now on (as an Xbox controller, so if you have a Playstation or some other controller, you'll still see Xbox-style prompts).

Some legitimate grievances I have with the game so far.

- No traditional menu. The overworld idea is cute, but it just gets in the way of the game.
- Not nearly enough lobbies.
- No ability to invite a player for a match directly from your friends list, as far as I can tell. This was present in Guilty Gear XrD. If there is a way and you know how to, please leave a comment.
- No ability to change the button prompts to generic ones, forced to see Xbox-style inputs (A, B, X and Y, instead of L, M, H and S). Very confusing, especially if not using the default layout.

Yet, the game looks and plays great, so I still recommend it.
