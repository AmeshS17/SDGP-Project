"This game is terrible.  Fights with random mobs take forever and aren't fun.  You must remember all the opponent animations to do well, which is kind of hard to be motivated to do when the game is hella depressing and lacks beauty almost completely.

Like undead?  You might like this game.  However, I can't stand the undead or post-apocalyptic art styles.

Some of the combat mechanics are straight-up infuriating.  When fighting, you wait for your opponent to do their 3-4 hit combo, then do two hits out of your combo, then dodge away and let them do their combo again.  Rinse, repeat. 

Also, ""If you like your weapon you can't keep your weapon.""  Thanks to the durability mechanic.  It's not uncommon to have weapons whose aesthetic you like come close to breaking between campfires, which means you will have to swap to weapons you don't like using in order to keep fighting effectively.  A lot of the weapons are gate kept simply because of their lack of durability or damage.

EDIT: Most of the problems with weapon type imbalances and gate keeping have been addressed in the updates, but some are still hardly worth using.

Finally, while some of the armor designs are great, you probably will be using a different armor than the one you want to because your weapon/armor combo pretty much requires frame-perfect dodging.

I'm mad that I spent money on this.

"This review was a long time coming from me, i kept postponing cause i was fairly immersed into the game and i also wanted to be sure to have enough ground/time to properly express my feelings/opinions on it.


So, here we go:



[b] Pros [/b]


‚ù§Ô∏è Very atmospheric


‚ù§Ô∏è Has A cool cast of interesting/diverse original characters ( npcs & bosses) and even some interesting mechanics tied to some of their questlines. 


‚ù§Ô∏è Beautiful music/ambiance


‚ù§Ô∏èQuite the array of memorable/original boss design ( although it has a a couple of lazy recolors in the dlcs)



‚ù§Ô∏è Nice Va



‚ù§Ô∏è Best and interesting selection of  cool armor sets in the  DS Saga, (thematic diversity is key)



‚ù§Ô∏è Has tons of Replayability 



‚ù§Ô∏è  Lots of cool/different kind of weapons and has the best  pyromancies  in the saga  ( Gotta love Warmth )



‚ù§Ô∏è Best Pvp in the saga, still fairly active to this day ( although check cons) you can make work alot of different builds/combinations.



‚ù§Ô∏è Does not Shy from trying being different/innovative, It has some DS 1 fanservice but it does not feel too overbearing ( it's not a fanservice fiesta like DS3) sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but it's indeed a breath of fresh air from the usual formula.



‚ù§Ô∏èExperiments alot with covenants and has alot of cool mechanics.



‚ù§Ô∏è Amazing Lore/Silent Storytelling tries to actually explain curse/reconnect to DS1 while also trying to put its own spin on it without fanservicing too much ( Dark souls 3) but at the same time, it shows that it's still quite mindful of the source material and, here and there, tries also to pay omage to it, opening alot of new possibilities to this entry in the series while also not tarnishing it's predecessor's glory.


‚ù§Ô∏è Graphically and spacially limited ( compared to Ds1 and DS3 not everything is thightly connected and some zones/ backgrounds are loaded in separatedly, some vistas in the distance might also be ""pre rendered"" cardboards) but, still manages to have your classic Shorcut p0rn the DS saga is famous for and  it still looks pretty ( graphically) good to this day.


‚ù§Ô∏è I have the most hours played in this than all of the other games of the series (combined) and i'm still playing it to this day.





[b]Cons[/b]


üíî In 2020 Pvp is still quite fun & alive but Arenas ( like Blood & Blues) are plagued by hackers which furtherly lowers in-world invasions ( this happens due to the absence of cracked red eyes and the main source of uncracked being heavily tied to the Blood covenant arena, there are ways to farm these effectively, but most players that want to just "" jump in and have fun"" will end up neglecting these completely and won't make the effort, i do not blame them btw) although this anomaly  pushed people to actually play all the other pvp covenants more than it originally happened in the game's glory days ( Bell Tower and Rat covenant are mostly clean from hackers, you get chunks early to upgrade your weapons to +10  and tails and other cool rewards + you are summoned for free, so you can just jump in and have fun without having to manually farm orbs from mobs), still, this is just a player adjustment in an effort to avoid the hacker plague that's ruining pvp, before it was a less of a problem cause there was just more people playing so hackers where like an occasional teardrop in a sea of good normal players, but since playerbase has shrank from the game's release, now it has become and actual issue, Arenas Like the bloods are completely unplayable due to hackers, which is sad cause if you need stuff like an early chaos fireball pyromancy or Wotg in your first playthough they're quite impossible to get now because you need alot of Arena wins, which, thanks to hackers, are quite impossible to get.


üíî it has some texture clipping here and there, but it's not as frequent as you'd imagine.


üíî Although it has some epic bosses  and arena designs ( Looking Glass knight, Sir Alonne, Fume Knight for example)  some of the dlcs ones are just shameless unfun buffed recolors (  Silver Ornstein, Blue Smelter, Lud & Zallen are some examples) 

üíî  The Sotfs upgrade actually messed up some cool textures in the game for example, they somehow ruined Ornifex's amazing ass ( probably due to poor texture scaling) and they sneakly added a blur to the binoculars so, hopefully you won't be able to notice, they also patched the air walking bug so you can't take a peek to Nashandra's nethers anymore.
	

[b]Final Consideration/verdict[/b]

Dark Souls II is my most played game in the saga for a reason ( I've also played the original physical copy from when it came out, so my total playtime it's farm more than 600 hours) It has alot of memorable characters and bosses, it's atmospheric, has the best pvp in the saga, you can experiment alot of build combinations/weapons/sets and, most importantly, it does not shy from being "" different"".

Sure, Dark souls 3 is full of amazing ds1 references and it's basically just a big nostalgia boner, but it didn't actually try to do anything new or innovative to ADD something to the series. 

I'm also aware that some new mechanics were removed from it due to time constraints, but even while taking them in full account, it would still have lacked  that "" something"" special  that  keeps Drawing me back to Dark souls 2, year after year. 

I think a quote from the opening cinematic describes that feeling  quite perfectly:


[i] [b]"" Long ago in a walled off land, far to the north, a great King built a great Kingdom i believe they called it Drangleic, perhaps you're familiar, no, how could you be.

But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate, without really knowing why.

"Honestly, I've tried this game like 3 times. I only got into it the 3rd time. At first i couldn't get anywhere and didn't seem to be making any progress due to not finding any bosses for a while, then i found 2 bosses in one night and felt like i actually achieved something. So basically just stick with it till you find that first boss. Other than that its like no other Dark Souls game and that's not a bad thing, the colors are amazing and its a nice change from the greyishness (i don't think that's a word) of the other 2 games. The keybinds suck though so look up how to immediately change them, one other thing before i wrap this up, TURN OFF DOUBLE CLICK, do this every time you turn the game on. If its not turned off there will be a delay before swings, look up a video on it, something like ""swing delay DS2"" should come up with results.

"Okay, so my last review on this game was entirely negative because I simply didn't enjoy it. However, having now completed the game, I look back and realise that it is not really that bad. I would still say that it's probably the weakest and easiest souls game, but it is still a great addition to the franchise despite its lack of connection to the story line.

Dark Souls 2 has a wide array of items and weapons to choose from. You could absolutely smash people with the Dragon Tooth or melt people's health with the Twinblades (which, btw, has multiple versions). Of course there are many more weapons, but these are my two favourites at the moment. Although I find the world building quite weak in this game in comparison to the others, the game really gives you an incentive to explore. For example, the Fragrant Branch of Yore and Pharros Lockstones (two mechanics which I used to not like) usually reveal useful loot, so you may not want to miss out on the opportunity to use them. 
     
In addition, the game is overall just quite fun. Other than the fact that some areas (Shrine of Amana, fucking die in a hole) just launch enemies at you left right and centre, most areas are quite fun to explore. For example, Drangleic Castle is one of my favourite areas in the series and is certainly my favourite in the game. I just love how empty and depressing it feels with King Vendrick's absence and just how lonely you feel in there. 

Lastly on the positive aspects, some of the bosses are fun too. Looking Glass Knight and the Pursuer are my two favourites. I find them incredibly fair and fun to fight and they don't fuck you over entirely which is quite a nice change from the normal souls formula. Although most of the bosses are basic in comparison to Bloodborne, DS3 or even DS1 in most cases, most of the bosses are still fun but some come out lacking.

In my last review I had major issues with this game and I still do agree with a couple of them. Firstly, the predominant artificial difficulty of this game sometimes made me want to uninstall it. The janky movements, the fact that the fog door animation can be interrupted and the abundance of enemies and ambushes sometimes can really become infuriating. 

Some of the bosses feel like rip offs from the first game. To name a few, Scorpioness Nahjka (Quelaag), Throne Watcher and Defender (O+S) and The Rotten (potentially Gravelord Nito vibes?). I wouldn't mind this factor if these bosses were more advanced than the ones they copied, but they honestly all feel less advanced and less fun, making them quite forgettable.

Finally, the backtracking required to beat the game is ridiculous. Imagine getting to the end of the game without finding the King's gates and then having to go back through all of the areas to look for them? I know that there are only three and they are in quite obvious positions, however this could be a major disheartening process for anyone who just wants the game to be over with (which I did as I felt that this games drags a slight bit). I know that DS1 did this after you obtain the Lordvessek but the game at least has the courtesy to show you where all 3 of the fog walls are that get unlocked.

In conclusion, I do believe that this game is significantly better than I thought it was in my last review. There are severe negatives to this game but I feel as though it is mostly balanced out by the positives. I find this game very fun and I have already started a new game which clearly shows that it is sick.
