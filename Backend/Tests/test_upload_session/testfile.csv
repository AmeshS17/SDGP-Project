9002270,english,"One of the worst games I have ever encountered in my life. Yes, it is in early access alpha. But the mod was just as bad. Basically, you spawn in a random location in the middle of nowhere. You have no clue where you are unless you've played the game for hundreds of hours, or you look up a map online and somehow find your location. Then, you start running. You run for about 20 minutes of real time. You will probably have zombies chasing you by then and since you have no way of defending yourself, you just have to run. If you find some sort of building, it is a guarantee that there is absolutely nothing in it whatsoever. So you move on and keep running, all the while having your character whine about how hungry and thirsty he is every 10 seconds. Eventually you may come across a can of beans. FOOD! Oh how great! Nope. You need a freaking can opener. I don't understand how people play this game. You accomplish absolutely nothing, and have zero fun while doing it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. At LEAST wait until it is released as a full game.

This is it... After ~4 years I am finally writing a review for this game.

I bought DayZ Standalone in 2013 (as a Freshman in Highschool) after playing the mod a bit and it was great then.

Fast forward to now, I am in my 3rd semester of college, and it finally releases to Beta. 

[b] See you guys in 2022 for full release [/b]

Jokes aside this beta release is ok at best. Tons of cut content from previous build, but the new engine optimizations and features are good, more fps. 

Personally I think that its too late to recover from the years of bad-talking that the game recieved for being in development so long. But, I hope that they can get it done and that it will [i] eventually [/i] be the game I wanted when I bought it back in 2013.

EDIT October 6th 2020. 
Well, 7 years after I bought the game I finally gave it another go with mods and its finally enjoyable. Mods that make it easier to find weapons/ AMMO for weapons and add safe zones and traders as well as loot drops and weed growing/ base building.

9973411,english,"*editing this review* Boy when this game came out it was a dumpster fire. I have played arma 2 mod and arma 3 mod (Dayz, exile, etc) for thousands of hours. I recently re-installed this game after seeing modded servers. Its very close to what Rocket originally promised when standalone was released, ONLY with mods though. It has come a very very long way. Close to the redemption story of No Mans Sky, but actually a fun game. At this point I am thoroughly enjoying this game. The vision from the mod to standalone I feel has finally been reached. This is the true vision of what I wanted when I learned of a zombie mod for arma 2 many many years ago. The crafting element is brilliant. For example I broke my leg, I knew how to fix it in Arma mods, but not here, so I logically got a stick and some rags and made a splint. I had no idea that was an option, but I started playing around with stuff and most of the things you can think to make for yourself, are available to make.......that is so freeing and refreshing. All in all the end comes down to playerbase. It makes or breaks servers, the random encounters you ""can"" have are some of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life. DayZ is finally good. Play it.


 This game is horrific. I played DayZ mod since it first launched a few years ago. This game is worse now as a standalone than the mod ever was. I'm ashamed that I continued to support this game on the lie that the standalone was going to be good. The UI is horrible and buggy, the zombies are awful, they glitch through walls. I stood and attacked a zombie with an axe and hit him 26 times before he died. This happened so often I literally stopped and counted. They glitch through walls, buildings, houses, and even cities. This game feels like a massive troll. Like it was designed with all these great ideas but implemented by retarded people. Like literally, retarded. Now that Rocket said he is leaving the company this game will only get worse. DO NOT BUY THIS. This is a disgrace. It may be the worst game i've ever played.
